<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.1 At least two non-return devices, one of which shall be a water seal, shall be fitted in the inert gas supply main, in order to prevent the return of hydrocarbon vapour to the machinery space uptakes or to any gas safe spaces under all normal conditions of trim, list and motion of the ship. They shall be located between the automatic valve required by paragraph 9.1 and the aftermost connection to any cargo tank or cargo pipeline.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.2 The devices referred to in paragraph 10.1 shall be located in the cargo area on deck.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.3 The water seal referred to in paragraph 10.1 shall be capable of being supplied by two separate pumps, each of which shall be capable of maintaining an adequate supply at all times.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.4 The arrangement of the seal and its associated fittings shall be such that it will prevent backflow of hydrocarbon vapours and will ensure the proper functioning of the seal under operating conditions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.5 Provision shall be made to ensure that the water seal is protected against freezing, in such a way that the integrity of seal is not impaired by overheating.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.6 A water loop or other approved arrangement shall also be fitted to each associated water supply and drain pipe and each venting or pressure-sensing pipe leading to gas safe spaces. Means shall be provided to prevent such loops from being emptied by vacuum.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.7 The deck water seal and all loop arrangements shall be capable of preventing return of hydrocarbon vapours at a pressure equal to the test pressure of the cargo tanks.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.8 The second device shall be a non-return valve or equivalent capable of preventing the return of vapours or liquids and fitted forward of the deck water seal required in paragraph 10.1. It shall be provided with positive means of closure. As an alternative to positive means of closure, an additional valve having such means of closure may be provided forward of the non-return valve to isolate the deck water seal from the inert gas main to cargo tanks.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.9 As an additional safeguard against the possible leakage of hydrocarbon liquids or vapours back from the deck main, means shall be provided to permit this section of the line between the valve having positive means of closure referred to in paragraph 10.8 and the valve referred to in paragraph 9 to be vented in a safe manner when the first of these valves is closed.</H4>
