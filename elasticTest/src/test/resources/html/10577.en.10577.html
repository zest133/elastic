<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 9</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Radiotelegraph stations</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The radiotelegraph station shall be so located that no harmful interference from extraneous mechanical or other noise will be caused to the proper reception of radio signals. The station shall be placed as high in the ship as is practicable, so that the greatest possible degree of safety may be secured.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The radiotelegraph operating room shall be of sufficient size and of adequate ventilation to enable the main and reserve radiotelegraph installations to be operated efficiently, and shall not be used for any purpose which will interfere with the operation of the radiotelegraph station.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The sleeping accommodation of at least one radio officer shall be situated as near as practicable to the radiotelegraph operating room. In new ships, this sleeping accommodation shall not be within the radiotelegraph operating room.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) There shall be provided between the radiotelegraph operating room and the bridge and one other place, if any, from which the ship is navigated, an efficient two-way system for calling and voice communication which shall be independent of the main communication system on the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) The radiotelegraph installation shall be installed in such a position that it will be protected against the harmful effects of water or extremes of temperature. It shall be readily accessible both for immediate use in case of distress and for repair.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) A reliable clock with a dial not less than 12.5 centimetres (5 inches) in diameter and a concentric seconds hand, the face of which is marked to indicate the silence periods prescribed for the radiotelegraph service by the Radio Regulations, shall be provided. It shall be securely mounted in the radiotelegraph operating room in such a position that the entire dial can be easily and accurately observed by the radio officer from the radiotelegraph operating position and from the position for testing the radiotelegraph auto alarm receiver.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) A reliable emergency light shall be provided in the radiotelegraph operating room, consisting of an electric lamp permanently arranged so as to provide satisfactory illumination of the operating controls of the main and reserve radiotelegraph installations and of the clock required by paragraph (f) of this regulation. In new installations, this lamp shall, if supplied from the reserve source of energy required by sub-paragraph (a)(iii) of regulation 10 of this Chapter, be controlled by two-way switches placed near the main entrance to the radiotelegraph operating room and at the radiotelegraph operating position, unless the layout of the radiotelegraph operating room does not warrant it. These switches shall be clearly labelled to indicate their purpose.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) Either an electric inspection lamp, operated from the reserve source of energy required by sub-paragraph (a)(iii) of regulation 10 of this Chapter and provided with a flexible lead of adequate length, or a flashlight shall be provided and kept in the radiotelegraph operating room.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(i) The radiotelegraph station shall be provided with such spare parts, tools and testing equipment as will enable the radiotelegraph installation to be maintained in efficient working condition while at sea. The testing equipment shall include an instrument or instruments for measuring A.C. volts, D.C. volts and ohms.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(j) If a separate emergency radiotelegraph operating room is provided the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of this regulation shall apply to it.</H4></BODY></HTML>
