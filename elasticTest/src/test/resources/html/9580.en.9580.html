<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Permissible Length of Compartments</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(a) Ships shall be as efficiently subdivided as is possible having regard to the nature of the service for which they are intended. The degree of subdivision shall vary with the length of the ship and with the service, in such manner that the highest degree of subdivision corresponds with the ships of greatest length, primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(b) Factor of Subdivision.</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>The maximum permissible length of a compartment having its centre at any point in the ship's length is obtained from the floodable length by multiplying the latter by an appropriate factor called the factor of subdivision. The factor of subdivision shall depend on the length of the ship, and for a given length shall vary according to the nature of the service for which the ship is intended. It shall decrease in a regular and continuous manner :</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(i) as the length of the ship increases, and</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(ii) from a factor A, applicable to ships primarily engaged in the carriage of cargo, to a factor B, applicable to ships primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>The variations of the factors A and B shall be expressed by the following formulae (I) and (II) where L is the length of the ship as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter:</H6>

<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i)</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(1) In the case of ships primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers, the subdivision abaft the forepeak shall be governed by a factor of 0.50 or by the factor determined according to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Regulation, if less than 0.50.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(2) In the case of such ships less than 91.5 metres (300 feet) in length, if the Administration is satisfied that compliance with such factor would be impracticable in a compartment, it may allow the length of that compartment to be governed by a higher factor provided the factor used is the lowest that is practicable and reasonable in the circumstances.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) Where, in the case of any ship whether less than 91.5 metres (300 feet) or not, the necessity of carrying appreciable quantities of cargo makes it impracticable to require the subdivision abaft the forepeak to be governed by a factor not exceeding 0.50, the standard of subdivision to be applied shall be determined in accordance with the following sub-paragraphs (1) to (5), subject to the condition that where the Administration is satisfied that insistence on strict compliance in any respect would be unreasonable, it may allow such alternative arrangement of the watertight bulkheads as appears to be justified on merit and will not diminish the general effectiveness of the subdivision.</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(1) The provisions of paragraph (c) of this Regulation relating to the criterion numeral shall apply with the exception that in calculating the value of P1 for berthed passengers K is to have the value defined in paragraph (c) of this Regulation, or 3.55 cubic m (125 cubic feet), whichever is the greater, and for unberthed passengers K is to have the value 3.55 cubic metres (125 cubic feet).</H6>
