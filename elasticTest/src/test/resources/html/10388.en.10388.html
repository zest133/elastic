<H3 class=regulation align=center>Protection of Control Stations</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>The ship shall comply with Regulation 35 (1948), except however that in cases where the disposition or construction of control stations is such as to preclude full compliance, e.g. timber construction of wheelhouse, the Administration may permit the use of free-standing non-combustible "B" Class divisions to protect the boundaries of such control stations. In such cases, where spaces immediately below such control stations constitute a significant fire hazard, the deck between shall be fully insulated as an "A" Class division.</H4></BODY></HTML>
