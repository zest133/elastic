<H4 class=subtitle>2.1 The requirements of paragraph 1 shall be determined by calculations which are in accordance with paragraphs 3, 4 and 6 and which take into consideration the proportions and design characteristics of the ship and the arrangement and configuration of the damaged compartments. In making these calculations the ship is to be assumed in the worst anticipated service condition as regards stability.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>2.2 Where it is proposed to fit decks, inner skins or longitudinal bulkheads of sufficient tightness to seriously restrict the flow of water, the Administration shall be satisfied that proper consideration is given to such restrictions in the calculations.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>2.3 The stability required in the final condition after damage, and after equalization where provided, shall be determined as follows:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3.1 The positive residual righting lever curve shall have a minimum range of 15° beyond the angle of equilibrium.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3.2 The area under the righting lever curve shall be at least 0.015 m-rad, measured from the angle of equilibrium to the lesser of:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 the angle at which progressive flooding occurs;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 22°(measured from the upright) in the case of one-compartment flooding, or 27° (measured from the upright) in the case of the simultaneous flooding of two or more adjacent compartments.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3.3 A residual righting lever is to be obtained within the range specified in 2.3.1, taking into account the greatest of the following heeling moments:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 the crowding of all passengers towards one side;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 the launching of all fully loaded davit-launched survival craft on one side;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 due to wind pressure;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>as calculated by the formula:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>GZ (in metres) = heeling moment / displacement + 0.04</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>However, in no case is this righting lever to be less than 0.10m.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3.4 For the purpose of calculating the heeling moments in paragraph 2.3.3, the following assumptions shall be made:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 Moments due to crowding of passengers:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1.1 4 persons per square metre;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1.2 a mass of 75kg for each passenger;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1.3 passengers shall be distributed on available deck areas towards one side of the ship on the decks where muster stations are located and in such a way that they produce the most adverse heeling moment.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 Moments due to launching of all fully loaded davit-launched survival craft on one side:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.1 all lifeboats and rescue boats fitted on the side to which the ship has heeled after having sustained damage shall be assumed to be swung out fully loaded and ready for lowering;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.2 for lifeboats which are arranged to be launched fully loaded from the stowed position, the maximum heeling moment during launching shall be taken;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.3 a fully loaded davit-launched liferaft attached to each davit on the side to which the ship has heeled after having sustained damage shall be assumed to be swung out ready for lowering; In intermed</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.4 persons not in the life-saving appliances which are swung out shall not provide either additional heeling or righting moment;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.5 life-saving appliances on the side of the ship opposite to the side to which the ship has heeled shall be assumed to be in a stowed position.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 Moments due to wind pressure:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3.1 a wind pressure of 120N/m² to be applied;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3.2 the area applicable shall be the projected lateral area of the ship above the waterline corresponding to the intact condition;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3.3 the moment arm shall be the vertical distance from a point at one half of the mean draught corresponding to the intact condition to the centre of gravity of the lateral area.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle>2.4 In intermediate stages of flooding, the maximum righting lever shall be at least 0.05 m and the range of positive righting levers shall be at least 7 degrees. In all cases, only one breach in the hull and only one free surface need be assumed. </H4></BODY></HTML>
