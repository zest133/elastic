<H3 class=regulation align=center>Information required in danger messages</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>The following information is required in danger messages:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1 Ice, derelicts and other direct dangers to navigation</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 The kind of ice, derelict or danger observed.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 The position of the ice, derelict or danger when last observed.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 The time and date (Universal Co-ordinated Time) when the danger was last observed.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2 Tropical cyclones (storms)*</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* The term tropical cyclone is the generic term used by national meteorological services of the World Meteorological Organization. The terms hurricane, typhoon, cyclone, severe tropical storm, etc, may also be used, depending on the geographical location.</H6></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 A statement that a tropical cyclone has been encountered. This obligation should be interpreted in a broad spirit, and information transmitted whenever the master has good reason to believe that a tropical cyclone is developing or exists in the neighbourhood.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 Time, date (Universal Co-ordinated Time) and position of ship when the observation was taken.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 As much of the following information as is practicable should be included in the message:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>- barometric pressure,* preferably corrected (stating millibars, millimetres, or inches, and whether corrected or uncorrected);</H6>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* The standard international unit for barometric pressure is the hectopascal (hPa) which is numerically equivalent to the millibar (mbar).</H6></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>- barometric tendency (the change in barometric pressure during the past three hours);</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>- true wind direction;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>- wind force (Beaufort scale);</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>- state of the sea (smooth, moderate, rough, high);</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>- swell (slight, moderate, heavy) and the true direction from which it comes. Period or length of swell (short, average, long) would also be of value;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>- true course and speed of ship.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left><STRONG>Subsequent observations</STRONG></H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3 When a master has reported a tropical cyclone or other dangerous storm, it is desirable but not obligatory, that further observations be made and transmitted hourly, if practicable, but in any case at intervals of not more than 3 hours, so long as the ship remains under the influence of the storm.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4 Winds of force 10 or above on the Beaufort scale for which no storm warning has been received. This is intended to deal with storms other than the tropical cyclones referred to in paragraph 2; when such a storm is encountered, the message should contain similar information to that listed under the paragraph but excluding the details concerning sea and swell.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5 Sub-freezing air temperatures associated with gale force winds causing severe ice accretion on superstructures:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 Time and date (Universal Co-ordinated Time).</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 Air temperature.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 Sea temperature (if practicable).</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 Wind force and direction.</H6>
