<H3 class=regulation align=center>Openings in watertight bulkheads and internal decks in cargo ships</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1. The number of openings in watertight subdivisions is to be kept to a minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship. Where penetrations of watertight bulkheads and internal decks are necessary for access, piping, ventilation, electrical cables, etc., arrangements are to he made to maintain the watertight integrity. The Administration may permit relaxation in the watertightness of openings above the freeboard deck, provided that it is demonstrated that any progressive flooding can be easily controlled and that the safety of the ship is not impaired.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2. Doors provided to ensure the watertight integrity of internal openings which are used while at sea are to be sliding watertight doors capable of being remotely closed from the bridge and are also to be operable locally from each side of the bulkhead. Indicators are to be provided at the control position showing whether the doors are open or closed, and an audible alarm is to be provided at the door closure. The power, control and indicators are to be operable in the event of main power failure. Particular attention is to be paid to minimize the effect of control system failure. Each power-operated sliding watertight door shall be provided with an individual hand-operated mechanism. It shall be possible to open and close the door by hand at the door itself from both sides.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3. Access doors and access hatch covers normally closed at sea, intended to ensure the watertight integrity of internal openings, shall be provided with means of indication locally and on the bridge showing whether these doors or hatch covers are open or closed. A notice is to be affixed to each such door or hatch cover to the effect that it is not to be left open. The use of such doors and hatch covers shall be authorized by the officer of the watch.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4. Watertight doors or ramps of satisfactory construction may be fitted to internally subdivide large cargo spaces, provided that the Administration is satisfied that such doors or ramps are essential. These doors or ramps may be hinged, rolling or sliding doors or ramps, but shall not be remotely controlled*. Such doors or ramps shall be closed before the voyage commences and shall be kept closed during navigation; the time of opening such doors or ramps in port and of closing them before the ship leaves port shall be entered in the log book. Should any of the doors or ramps be accessible during the voyage, they shall be fitted with a device which prevents unauthorised opening.</H4>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5. Other closing appliances which are kept permanently closed at sea to ensure the watertight integrity of internal openings shall be provided with a notice which is to be affixed to each such closing appliance to the effect that it is to be kept closed. Manholes fitted with closely bolted covers need not be so marked.</H4></BODY></HTML>
