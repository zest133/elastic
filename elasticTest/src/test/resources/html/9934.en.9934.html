<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fixed High Expansion Froth Fire-Extinguishing Systems in Machinery Spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a)</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Any required fixed high expansion froth system in machinery spaces shall be capable of rapidly discharging through fixed discharge outlets a quantity of froth sufficient to fill the greatest space to be protected at a rate of at least 1 metre (3.3 feet) in depth per minute. The quantity of froth - forming liquid available shall be sufficient to produce a volume of froth equal to five times the volume of the largest space to be protected. The expansion ratio of the froth shall not exceed 1,000 to 1.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) The Administration may permit alternative arrangements and discharge rates provided that it is satisfied that equivalent protection is achieved.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Supply ducts for delivering froth, air intakes to the froth generator and the number of froth-producing units shall in the opinion of the Administration be such as will provide effective froth production and distribution.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The arrangement of the froth generator delivery ducting shall be such that a fire in the protected space will not affect the froth-generating equipment.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The froth generator, its sources of power supply, froth-forming liquid and means of controlling the system shall be readily accessible and simple to operate and shall be grouped in as few locations as possible at positions not likely to be cut off by fire in the protected space.</H4></BODY></HTML>
