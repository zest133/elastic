<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Penetration in fire -resisting divisions and prevention of heat transmission </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 Where "A" class divisions are penetrated, such penetrations shall be tested in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code, subject to the provisions of paragraph 4.1.1.5. In the case of ventilation ducts, paragraphs 7.1.2 and 7.3.1 apply. However, where a pipe penetration is made of steel or equivalent material having a thickness of 3mm or greater and a length of not less than 900 mm (preferably 450 mm on each side of the division), and no openings, testing is not required. Such penetrations shall be suitably insulated by extension of the insulation at the same level of the division. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 Where "B" class divisions are penetrated for the passage of electric cables, pipes, trunks, ducts, etc., or for the fitting of ventilation terminals, lighting fixtures and similar devices, arrangements shall be made to ensure that the fire resistance is not impaired, subject to the provisions of paragraph 7.3.2. Pipes other than steel or copper that penetrate "B" class divisions shall be protected by either: </H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 a fire tested penetration device, suitable for the fire resistance of the division pierced and the type of pipe used; or </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 a steel sleeve, having a thickness of not less than 1.8 mm and a length of not less than 900 mm for pipe diameters of 150 mm or more and not less than 600 mm for pipe diameters of less than 150 mm (preferably equally divided to each side of the division). The pipe shall be connected to the ends of the sleeve by flanges or couplings; or the clearance between the sleeve and the pipe shall not exceed 2.5 mm; or any clearance between pipe and sleeve shall be made tight by means of non-combustible or other suitable material. </H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.3 Uninsulated metallic pipes penetrating "A" or "B" class divisions shall be of materials having a melting temperature which exceeds 950 degrees C for "A-0" and 850 degrees C for "B-0" class divisions. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.4 In approving structural fire protection details, the Administration shall have regard to the risk of heat transmission at intersections and terminal points of required thermal barriers. The insulation of a deck or bulkhead shall be carried past the penetration, intersection or terminal point for a distance of at least 450 mm in the case of steel and aluminium structures. If a space is divided with a deck or a bulkhead of "A" class standard having insulation of different values, the insulation with the higher value shall continue on the deck or bulkhead with the insulation of the lesser value for a distance of at least 450 mm. </H5></BODY></HTML>
