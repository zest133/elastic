<H3 class=regulation align=center>Means of escape</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(Paragraph 1.8 of this regulation applies to ships constructed on or after 1 January 1994)</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Stairways and ladders shall be arranged to provide ready means of escape to the lifeboat and liferaft embarkation deck from all passenger and crew spaces and from spaces in which the crew is normally employed, other than machinery spaces. In particular, the following provisions shall be complied with:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 Below the bulkhead deck two means of escape, at least one of which shall be independent of watertight doors, shall be provided from each watertight compartment or similarly restricted space or group of spaces. Exceptionally, the Administration may dispense with one of the means of escape, due regard being paid to the nature and location of spaces and to the number of persons who might normally be employed there.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 Above the bulkhead deck there shall be at least two means of escape from each main vertical zone or similarly restricted space or group of spaces at least one of which shall give access to a stairway forming a vertical escape.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 If a radiotelegraph station has no direct access to the open deck, two means of escape from or access to such station shall be provided, one of which may be a porthole or window of sufficient size or another means to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 A corridor, lobby, or part of a corridor from which there is only one route of escape shall be prohibited.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 At least one of the means of escape required by paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 shall consist of a readily accessible enclosed stairway, which shall provide continuous fire shelter from the level of its origin to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks, or to the uppermost weather deck if the embarkation deck does not extend to the main vertical zone being considered. In the latter case, direct access to the embarkation deck by way of external open stairways and passageways shall be provided and shall have emergency lighting in accordance with regulation III/11.5 and slip-free surfaces under foot. Boundaries facing external open stairways and passageways forming part of an escape route and boundaries in such a position that their failure during a fire would impede escape to the embarkation deck shall have fire integrity, including insulation values, in accordance with the tables in regulation II-2/26. The widths, number and continuity of escapes shall be as follows:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5.1 Stairways shall not be less than 900 mm in clear width. Stairways shall be fitted with handrails on each side. The minimum clear width of stairways shall be increased by 10 mm for every one person provided for in excess of 90 persons. The maximum clear width between handrails where stairways are wider than 900 mm shall be 1,800 mm. The total number of persons to be evacuated by such stairways shall be assumed to be two thirds of the crew and the total number of passengers in the areas served by such stairways. The width of the stairways shall conform to the standards not inferior to those adopted by the Organization.*</H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Reference is made to the standards to be developed by organization</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5.2 All stairways sized for more than 90 persons shall be aligned fore and aft.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5.3 Doorways and corridors and intermediate landings included in means of escape shall be sized in the same manner as stairways.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5.4 Stairways shall not exceed 3.5 m in vertical rise without the provision of a landing and shall not have an angle of inclination greater than 45 degrees.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5.5 Landings at each deck level shall be not less than 2m²in area and shall increase by 1m<SUP>2</SUP> for every 10 persons provided for in excess of 20 persons but need not exceed 16m², except for those landings servicing public spaces having direct access onto the stairway enclosure.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 Protection of access from the stairway enclosures to the lifeboat and liferaft embarkation areas shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.7 Stairways serving only a space and a balcony in that space shall not be considered as forming one of the required means of escape.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.8 Where public spaces span three or more decks and contain combustibles such as furniture and enclosed spaces such as shops, offices and restaurants, each level within the space shall have two means of escape, one of which shall give direct access to an enclosed vertical means of escape meeting the requirements of paragraph 5.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.9 Where the Administration has granted dispensation under the provisions of paragraph .1.1, this sole means of escape shall provide safe escape. However, stairways shall not be less than 800 mm in clear width with handrails on both sides.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.10 In addition to the emergency lighting required by regulations II-1/42 and III/11.5, the means of escape including stairways and exits, shall be marked by lighting or photoluminescent strip indicators placed not more than 0.3 m above the deck at all points of the escape route including angles and intersections. The marking must enable passengers to identify all the routes of escape and readily identify the escape exits. If electric illumination is used, it shall be supplied by the emergency source of power and it shall be so arranged that the failure of any single light or cut in a lighting strip, will not result in the marking being ineffective. Additionally, all escape route signs and fire equipment location markings shall be of photoluminescent material or marked by lighting. The Administration shall ensure that such lighting or photoluminescent equipment have been evaluated, tested and applied in accordance with the guidelines developed by the Organization **.</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Reference is made to the standards to be developed by organization.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.1 In special category spaces the number and disposition of the means of escape both below and above the bulkhead deck shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration and in general the safety of access to the embarkation deck shall be at least equivalent to that provided for under paragraphs 1.1, 1.2, 1.5 and 1.6.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.2 One of the escape routes from the machinery spaces where the crew is normally employed shall avoid direct access to any special category space.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.1 Two means of escape shall be provided from each machinery space. In particular, the following provisions shall be complied with:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 Where the space is below the bulkhead deck the two means of escape shall consist of either:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.1 two sets of steel ladders as widely separated as possible, leading to doors in the upper part of the space similarly separated and from which access is provided to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks. One of these ladders shall provide continuous fire shelter from the lower part of the space to a safe position outside the space; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.2 one steel ladder leading to a door in the upper part of the space from which access is provided to the embarkation deck and additionally, in the lower part of the space and in a position well separated from the ladder referred to, a steel door capable of being operated from each side and which provides access to a safe escape route from the lower part of the space to the embarkation deck.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 Where the space is above the bulkhead deck, the two means of escape shall be as widely separated as possible and the doors leading from such means of escape shall be in a position from which access is provided to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks. Where such means of escape require the use of ladders, these shall be of steel.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.2 In a ship of less than 1,000 tons gross tonnage, the Administration may dispense with one of the means of escape, due regard being paid to the width and disposition of the upper part of the space; and in a ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and above, the Administration may dispense with one means of escape from any such space so long as either a door or a steel ladder provides a safe escape route to the embarkation deck, due regard being paid to the nature and location of the space and whether persons are normally employed in that space.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.3 Two means of escape shall be provided from a machinery control room located within a machinery space, at least one of which will provide continuous fire shelter to a safe position outside the machinery space.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 In no case shall lifts be considered as forming one of the required means of escape.</H4></BODY></HTML>
