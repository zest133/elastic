<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 25-4</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Attained subdivision index "A"</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The attained subdivision index "A", calculated in accordance with this regulation, shall not be less than the required subdivision index "R", calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 of regulation 25-3.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The attained subdivision index "A" shall be calculated for the ship by the following formula;</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>A =&nbsp; <IMG src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.90.a01.021.2504/en/eqn1.gif" NAMO_EQN__="NAMO_EQN__"></H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>where:</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>"i" represents each compartment or group of compartments under consideration,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>" p i" accounts for the probability that only the compartment or group of compartments under consideration may be flooded, disregarding any horizontal subdivision,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>" s i" accounts for the probability of survival after flooding the compartment or group of compartments under consideration, including the effects of any horizontal subdivision.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 In calculating "A", level trim shall be used.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 This summation covers only those cases of flooding which contribute to the value of the attained subdivision index "A".</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 The summation indicated by the above formula shall be taken over the ship's length for all cases of flooding in which a single compartment or two or more adjacent compartments are involved.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Wherever wing compartments are fitted, contribution to the summation indicated by the formula shall be taken for all cases of flooding in which wing compartments are involved; and additionally, for all cases of simultaneous flooding of a wing compartment or compartments and the adjacent inboard compartment or compartments, assuming a rectangular penetration which extends to the ship's centreline, but excludes damage to any centreline bulkhead.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 The assumed vertical extent of damage is to extend from the baseline upwards to any watertight horizontal subdivision above the waterline or higher. However, if a lesser extent will give a more severe result, such extent is to be assumed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 If pipes, ducts or tunnels are situated within assumed flooded compartments, arrangements are to be made to ensure that progressive flooding cannot thereby extend to compartments other than those assumed flooded. However, the Administration may permit minor progressive flooding if it is demonstrated that its effects can be easily controlled and the safety of the ship is not impaired.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9 In the flooding calculations carried out according to the regulations, only one breach of the hull need be assumed.</H4></BODY></HTML>
