<H3 class=regulation align=center>Protection of Stairways and Life Accommodation and Service Spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) All stairways shall be of steel frame construction except where the Administration sanctions the use of other equivalent material, and shall be within enclosures formed of "A" Class divisions, with positive means of closure at all openings, except that:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) a stairway connecting only two decks need not be enclosed, provided the integrity of the deck is maintained by proper bulkheads or doors at one between deck space. When a stairway is closed at one between deck space, the stairway enclosure shall be protected in accordance with the tables for decks in Regulation 20 of this Chapter;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) stairways may be fitted in the open in a public space, provided they lie wholly within such public space.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Stairway enclosures shall have direct communication with the corridors and be of sufficient area to prevent congestion, having in view the number of persons likely to use them in an emergency. In so far as practicable, stairway enclosures shall not give direct access to cabins, service lockers, or other enclosed spaces containing combustibles in which a fire is likely to originate.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Lift trunks shall be so fitted as to prevent the passage of smoke and flame from one between deck to another and shall be provided with means of closing so as to permit the control of draught and smoke.</H4></BODY></HTML>
