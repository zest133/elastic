<H2 class=part align=center>PART F - ALTERNATIVE DESIGN AND ARRANGEMENTS</H2>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 17</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Alternative design and arrangements</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1. Purpose</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>The purpose of this regulation is to provide a methodology for alternative design and arrangements for fire safety.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 General</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 Fire safety design and arrangements may deviate from the prescriptive requirements set out in Parts B, C, D, E or G, provided that the design and arrangements meet the fire safety objectives and the functional requirements.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 When fire safety design or arrangements deviate from the prescriptive requirements of this chapter, engineering analysis, evaluation and approval of the alternative design and arrangements shall be carried out in accordance with this regulation.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Engineering analysis</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>The engineering analysis shall be prepared and submitted to the Administration, based on the guidelines developed by the Organization* and shall include, as a minimum, the following elements:</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Guidelines on alternative design and arrangements for fire safety (<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12823&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.1002</A>). </H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 determination of the ship type and space(s) concerned;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 identification of prescriptive requirement(s) with which the ship or the space(s) will not comply;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 identification of the fire and explosion hazards of the ship or the space(s) concerned;</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3.1 identification of the possible ignition sources;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3.2 identification of the fire growth potential of each space concerned;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3.3 identification of the smoke and toxic effluent generation potential for each space concerned;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3.4 identification of the potential for the spread of fire, smoke or of toxic effluents from the space(s) concerned to other spaces;</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 determination of the required fire safety performance criteria for the ships or the space(s) concerned addressed by the prescriptive requirement(s);</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4.1 performance criteria shall be based on the fire safety objectives and on the functional requirements of this chapter;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4.2 performance criteria shall provide a degree of safety not less than that achieved by using the prescriptive requirements; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4.3 performance criteria shall be quantifiable and measurable;</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 detailed description of the alternative design and arrangements, including a list of the assumptions used in the design and any proposed operational restrictions or conditions; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 technical justification demonstrating that the alternative design and arrangements meet the required fire safety performance criteria.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Evaluation of the alternative design and arrangements</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 The engineering analysis required in paragraph 3 shall be evaluated and approved by the Administration taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization.*</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Guidelines on alternative design and arrangements for fire safety (<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12823&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.1002</A>). </H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 A copy of the documentation, as approved by the Administration, indicating that the alternative design and arrangements comply with this regulation shall be carried onboard the ship.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Exchange of information</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>The Administration shall communicate to the Organization pertinent information concerning alternative design and arrangements approved by them for circulation to all contracting governments.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Re-evaluation due to change of conditions</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>If the assumptions, and operational restrictions that were stipulated in the alternative design and arrangements are changed, the engineering analysis shall be carried out under the changed condition and shall be approved by the Administration.</H4></BODY></HTML>
