<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) The ship, whether new or existing, shall at all times when at sea, or in port (except when out of service), be so manned or equipped as to ensure that any initial fire alarm is immediately received by a responsible member of the crew.</H5>

<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(ii) In a ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards, the arrangement of sea connexions, pumps and sources of power for operating them shall be such as to ensure that a fire in any one compartment will not put all the fire pumps out of action.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(iii) In a ship of less than 1,000 tons gross tonnage the arrangements shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>

<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) In accommodation, service and machinery spaces, the number and position of hydrants shall be such that the requirements of paragraph (d) of Regulation 5 of this Chapter may be complied with when all watertight doors and all doors in main vertical zone bulkheads are closed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) The arrangements shall be such that at least two jets of water can reach any part of any car go space when empty.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) All required hydrants in the machinery spaces of ships with oil-fired boilers or internal combustion type propelling machinery shall be fitted with hoses having nozzles as required in paragraph (g) of Regulation 5 of this Chapter.</H5>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) Fixed Fire-Extinguishing Arrangements in Cargo Spaces.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The cargo spaces of ships of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall be protected by a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system complying with Regulation 8 of this Chapter.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that a ship is engaged on voyages of such short duration that it would be unreasonable to apply the requirements of sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph and also in ships of less than 1,000 tons gross tonnage, the arrangements in cargo spaces shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) Fire-Extinguishing Appliances in Boiler Rooms, etc..</H4>
