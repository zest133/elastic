<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Inerting, ventilation and gas measurement.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 This paragraph shall apply to oil tankers constructed on or after 1 October 1994</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 Double hull and double bottom spaces shall be fitted with suitable connections for the supply of air.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.3 On tankers required to be fitted with inert gas systems:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 double hull spaces shall be fitted with suitable connections for the supply of inert gas;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 where such spaces are connected to a permanently fitted inert gas distribution system, means shall be provided to prevent hydrocarbon gases from the cargo tanks entering the double hull spaces through the system;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 where such spaces are not permanently connected to an inert gas distribution system, appropriate means shall be provided to allow connection to the inert gas main.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.4.1 Suitable portable instruments for measuring oxygen and flammable vapour concentrations shall be provided. In selecting these instruments, due attention shall be given for their use in combination with the fixed gas sampling line systems referred to in paragraph 4.4.2.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.4.2 where atmosphere in double hull spaces cannot be reliably measured using flexible gas sampling hoses, such spaces shall be fitted with permanent gas sampling lines. The configuration of such line systems shall be adapted to the design of such spaces.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.4.3 The materials of construction and the dimensions of gas sampling lines shall be such as to prevent restriction. Where plastic materials are used, they should be electrically conductive.</H5>
