<H3 class=regulation align=center>Surveys of Hull, Machinery and Equipment of Cargo Ships</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The hull, machinery and equipment (other than items in respect of which Cargo Ship Safety Equipment Certificates, Cargo Ship Safety Radiotelegraphy Certificates or Cargo Ship Radiotelephony Certificates are issued) of a cargo ship shall be surveyed on completion and thereafter in such a manner as the Administration may consider necessary in order to ensure that their condition is in all respects satisfactory and at the following intervals :</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) at intervals specified by the Administration but not exceeding five years (periodical surveys);</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) in addition to such periodical surveys a tanker of ten years of age and over shall undergo a minimum of one intermediate survey during the period of validity of its Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate. In cases where only one such intermediate survey is carried out in any one certificate validity period, it shall be held not before six months prior to, nor later than six months after, the half-way date of the certificate's period of validity.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The initial and periodical survey shall be such as to ensure that the arrangements, material and scantlings of the structure, boilers and other pressure vessels, their appurtenances, main and auxiliary machinery including steering gear and associated control systems, electrical installation and other equipment are in all respects satisfactory for the service for which the ship is intended. Such surveys shall, in the case of tankers, also include inspection of the outside of the ship's bottom, pump rooms, cargo and bunker piping systems, vent piping, pressure vacuum valves and flame screens.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The intermediate survey of tankers of ten years of age and over shall include inspection of steering gear equipment and associated control systems, pump rooms, cargo and bunker piping systems on deck and in pump rooms, vent piping, pressure vacuum valves and flame screens, the electrical installations in dangerous zones, and the outside of the ship's bottom. In addition to the visual inspection of the electrical installation, the insulation resistance of the electrical equipment in dangerous zones is to be tested. If, upon examination, there should be any doubt as to the condition of the piping, extra measures, such as pressure tests and thickness determination, shall be taken as necessary. Such intermediate surveys shall be endorsed on the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate issued in accordance with regulation 12(a)(ii) of Chapter I of the Convention.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) A survey, either general or partial according to the circumstances, shall be made when required after an investigation prescribed in Regulation 11 of this Chapter, or whenever any important repairs or renewals are made. The survey shall be such as to ensure that the necessary repairs or renewals have been effectively made, that the material and workmanship of such repairs or renewals are in all respects satisfactory, and that the ship is fit to proceed to sea without danger to the ship or persons on board.</H4></BODY></HTML>
