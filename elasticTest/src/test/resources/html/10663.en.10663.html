<H3 class=regulation>Pilot Ladders and Mechanical Pilot Hoists</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle>Ships engaged on voyages in the course of which pilots are likely to be employed shall comply with the following requirements:</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>(a) Pilot Ladders</H4>
<H5 class=body1>(i) The ladder shall be efficient for the purpose of enabling pilots to embark and disembark safely, kept clean and in good order and may be used by officials and other persons while a ship is arriving at or leaving a port.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(ii) The ladder shall be secured in a position so that it is clear from any possible discharges from the ship, that each step rests firmly against the ship's side, that it is clear so far as is practicable of the finer lines of the ship and that the pilot can gain safe and convenient access to the ship after climbing not less than 1.5 metres (5 feet) and not more than 9 metres (30 feet). A single length of ladder shall be used capable of reaching the water from the point of access to the ship; in providing for this due allowance shall be made for all conditions of loading and trim of the ship and for an adverse list of 15 degrees. Whenever the distance from sea level to the point of access to the ship is more than 9 metres (30 feet), access from the pilot ladder to the ship shall be by means of an accommodation ladder or other equally safe and convenient means.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(iii) The steps of the pilot ladder shall be:</H5>
<H6 class=body2>(1) of hardwood, or other material of equivalent properties, made in one piece free of knots, having an efficient non-slip surface; the four lowest steps may be made of rubber of sufficient strength and stiffness or of other suitable material of equivalent characteristics ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2>(2) not less than 480 millimetres (19 inches) long, 115millimetres (4½ inches) wide, and 25 millimetres (1 inch) in depth, excluding any non-slip device;</H6>
<H6 class=body2>(3) equally spaced not less than 300 millimetres (12 inches) nor more than 380 millimetres (15 inches) apart and be secured in such a manner that they will remain horizontal.</H6>
<H5 class=body1>(iv) No pilot ladder shall have more than two replacement steps which are secured in position by a method different from that used in the original construction of the ladder and any steps so secured shall be replaced as soon as reasonably practicable by steps secured in position by the method used in the original construction of the ladder. When any replacement step is secured to the side ropes of the ladder by means of grooves in the sides of the step, such grooves shall be in the longer sides of the step.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(v) the side ropes of the ladder shall consist of two uncovered manila ropes not less than 60 millimetres (2¼ inches) in circumference on each side. Each rope shall be continuous with no joints below the top step. Two man-ropes properly secured to the ship and not less than 65 millimetres (2½ inches) in circumference and a safety line shall be kept at hand ready for use if required.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(vi) Battens made of hardwood, or other material of equivalent properties, in one piece and not less than 1.80 metres (5 feet 10 inches) long shall be provided at such intervals as will prevent the pilot ladder from twisting. The lowest batten shall be on the fifth step from the bottom of the ladder and the interval between any batten and the next shall not exceed 9 steps.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(vii) Means shall be provided to ensure safe and convenient passage on to or into and off the ship between the head of the pilot ladder or of any accommodation ladder or other appliance provided. Where such passage is by means of a gateway in the rails or bulwark, adequate handholds shall be provided. Where such passage is by means of a bulwark ladder, such ladder shall be securely attached to the bulwark rail or platform and two handhold stanchions shall be fitted at the point of boarding or leaving the ship not less than 0.70 metre (2 feet 3 inches) nor more than 0.80 metre (2 feet 7 inches) apart. Each stanchion shall be rigidly secured to the ship's structure at or near its base and also at a higher point, shall be not less than 40 millimetres (1½ inches) in diameter and shall extend not less than 1.20 metres (3 feet 11 inches) above the top of the bulwark.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(viii) Lighting shall be provided at night such that both the pilot ladder overside and also the position where the pilot boards the ship shall be adequately lit. A lifebuoy equipped with a self-igniting light shall be kept at hand ready for use. A heaving line shall be kept at hand ready for use if required.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(ix) Means shall be provided to enable the pilot ladder to be used on either side of the ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(x) The rigging of the ladder and the embarkation and disembarkation of a pilot shall be supervised by a responsible officer of the ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(xi) Where on any ship constructional features such as rubbing bands would prevent the implementation of any of these provisions, special arrangements shall be made to the satisfaction of the Administration to ensure that persons are able to embark and disembark safely.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>(b) Mechanical Pilot Hoists</H4>
<H5 class=body1>(i) A mechanical pilot hoist, if provided, and its ancillary equipment shall be of a type approved by the Administration. It shall be of such design and construction as to ensure that the pilot can be embarked and disembarked in a safe manner including a safe access from the hoist to the deck and vice versa.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(ii) A pilot ladder complying with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this regulation shall be kept on deck adjacent to the hoist and available for immediate use.</H5></BODY></HTML>
