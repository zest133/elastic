<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 4</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fire pumps, fire mains, hydrants and hoses</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Every ship shall be provided with fire pumps, fire mains, hydrants and hoses complying as applicable with the requirements of this Regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Capacity of fire pumps</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 The required fire pumps shall be capable of delivering for fire-fighting purposes a quantity of water, at the pressure specified in paragraph 4, as follows:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 pumps in passenger ships, not less than two-thirds of the quantity required to be dealt with by the bilge pumps when employed for bilge pumping; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 pumps in cargo ships, other than any emergency pump, not less than four-thirds of the quantity required under Regulation II-1/21 to be dealt with by each of the independent bilge pumps in a passenger ship of the same dimension when employed in bilge pumping, provided that in no cargo ship need the total required capacity of the fire pumps exceed 180m³/hour.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 Each of the required fire pumps (other than any emergency pump required in paragraph 3.3.2 for cargo ships)shall have a capacity not less than 80 percent of the total required capacity divided by the minimum number of required fire pumps but in any case not less than 25m³/hour and each such pump shall in any event be capable of delivering at least the two required jets of water. These fire pumps shall be capable of supplying the fire main system under the required conditions. Where more pumps than the minimum of required pumps are installed the capacity of such additional pumps shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Arrangements of fire pumps and of fire mains</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 Ships shall be provided with independently driven fire pumps as follows:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 Passenger ships of 4,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards at least three</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 Passenger ships of less than 4,000 tons gross tonnage and cargo ships of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards at least two</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 Cargo ships of less than 1,000 tons gross tonnage to the satisfaction of the Administration</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 Sanitary, ballast, bilge or general service pumps may be accepted as fire pumps, provided that they are not normally used for pumping oil and that if they are subject to occasional duty for the transfer or pumping of oil fuel, suitable change-over arrangements are fitted.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.3 The arrangement of sea connections, fire pumps and their sources of power shall be such as to ensure that:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 In passenger ships of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards, in the event of a fire in any one compartment all the fire pumps will not be put out of action.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 In cargo ships of 2,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards if a fire in any one compartment could put all the pumps out of action there shall be an alternative means consisting of a fixed independently driven emergency pump which shall be capable of supplying two jets of water to the satisfaction of the Administration. The pump and its location shall comply with the following requirements:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.1 The capacity of the pump shall not be less than 40 percent of the total capacity of the fire pumps required by this Regulation. and in any case not less than 25 m³/hour.</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.2 When the pump is delivering the quantity of water required by paragraph 3.3.2.1 the pressure at any hydrant shall be not less than the minimum pressures given in paragraph 4.2.</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.3 Any diesel driven power source for the pump shall be capable of being readily started in its cold condition down to a temperature of 0°C by hand (manual) cranking. If this is impracticable, or if lower temperatures are likely to be encountered, consideration is to be given to the provision and maintenance of heating arrangements, acceptable to the Administration, so that ready starting will be assured. If hand (manual) starting is impracticable the Administration may permit other means of starting. These means shall be such as to enable the diesel driven power source to be started at least 6 times within a period of 30 minutes, and at least twice within the first 10 minutes.</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.4 Any service fuel tank shall contain sufficient fuel to enable the pump to run on full load for at least three hours and sufficient reserves of fuel shall be available outside the main machinery space to enable the pump to be run on full load for an additional 15 hours.</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.5 The total suction head of the pump shall not exceed 4.5 m under all conditions of list and trim likely to be encountered in service and the suction piping shall be designed to minimize suction losses.</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.6 The boundaries of the space containing the fire pump shall be insulated to a standard of structural fire protection equivalent to that required for a control room in Regulation 44.</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.7 No direct access shall be permitted between the machinery space and the space containing the emergency fire pump and its source of power. When this is impracticable an Administration may accept an arrangement where the access is by means of an airlock, each of the two doors being self-closing, or through a watertight door capable of being operated from a space remote from the machinery space and the space containing the emergency fire pump and unlikely to be cut off in the event of fire in those spaces. In such cases a second means of access to the space containing the emergency fire pump and its source of power shall be provided.</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.8 Ventilation arrangements to the space containing the independent source of power for the emergency fire pump shall be such as to preclude, as far as practicable, the possibility of smoke from a machinery space fire entering or being drawn into that space.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 In passenger ships of less than 1,000 tons gross tonnage and cargo ships of less than 2,000 tons gross tonnage, if a fire in any one compartment could put all the pumps out of action the alternative means of providing water for fire-fighting purposes are to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 In addition, in cargo ships where other pumps, such as general service, bilge and ballast, etc., are fitted in a machinery space, arrangements shall be made to ensure that at least one of these pumps, having the capacity and pressure required by paragraphs 2.2 and 4.2, is capable of providing water to the fire main.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.4 The arrangements for the ready availability of water supply shall be:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 in passenger ships of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards such that at least one effective jet of water is immediately available from any hydrant in an interior location and so as to ensure the continuation of the output of water by the automatic starting of a required fire pump;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 in passenger ships of less than 1,000 tons gross tonnage and in cargo ships to the satisfaction of the Administration;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 in cargo ships with a periodically unattended machinery space or when only one person is required on watch there shall be immediate water delivery from the fire main system at a suitable pressure, either by remote starting of one of the main fire pumps with remote starting from the navigating bridge and fire control station, if any, or permanent pressurization of the fire main system by one of the main fire pumps, except that the Administration may waive this requirement for cargo ships of less than 1,600 tons gross tonnage if the arrangement of the machinery space access makes it unnecessary;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 in passenger ships, if fitted with periodically unattended machinery spaces in accordance with Reg. II-1/54, the Administration shall determine provisions for fixed water fire-extinguishing arrangement for such spaces equivalent to those required for normally attended machinery spaces.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.5 Relief valves shall be provided in conjunction with all fire pumps if the pumps are capable of developing a pressure exceeding the design pressure of the water service pipes, hydrants and hoses. These valves shall be so placed and adjusted as to prevent excessive pressure in any part of the fire main system.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.6 In tankers isolation valves shall be fitted in the fire main at poop front in a protected position and on the tank deck at intervals of not more than 40 m to preserve the integrity of the fire main system in case of fire or explosion.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Diameter of and pressure in the fire mains</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 The diameter of the fire main and water service pipes shall be sufficient for the effective distribution of the maximum required discharge from two fire pumps operating simultaneously, except that in the case of cargo ships the diameter need only be sufficient for the discharge of 140 m³/hour</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 With the two pumps simultaneously delivering through nozzles specified in paragraph 8 the quantity of water specified in paragraph 4.1, through any adjacent hydrants, the following minimum pressures shall be maintained at all hydrants:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>Passenger ships:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>4,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards: 0.31 N/mm²</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards but under 4,000 tons gross tonnage: 0.27 N/mm²</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>Under 1,000 tons gross: To the satisfaction tonnage of the Administration</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>Cargo ships:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>6,00 tons gross tonnage and upwards: 0.27 N/mm²</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards but under 6,000 tons gross tonnage: 0.25 N/mm²</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>Under 1,000 tons gross tonnage: To the satisfaction of the Administration</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.3 The maximum pressure at any hydrant shall not exceed that at which the effective control of a fire hose can be demonstrated.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Number and position of hydrants</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.1 The number and position of hydrants shall be such that at least two jets of water not emanating from the same hydrant, one of which shall be from a single length of hose, may reach any part of the ship normally accessible to the passengers or crew while the ship is being navigated and any part of any cargo space when empty, any ro-ro cargo space or any special category space in which latter case the two jets shall reach any part of such space, each from a single length of hose. Furthermore, such hydrants shall be positioned near the accesses to the protected spaces.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.2 In the accommodation, service and machinery spaces of passenger ships the number and position of hydrants shall be such that the requirements of paragraph 5.1 may be complied with when all watertight doors and all doors in main vertical zone bulkheads are closed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.3 Where, in a passenger ship, access is provided to a machinery space of category A at a low level from an adjacent shaft tunnel, two hydrants shall be provided external to, but near the entrance to that machinery space. Where such access is provided from other spaces, in one of those spaces two hydrants shall be provided near the entrance to the machinery space of category A. Such provision need not be made where the tunnel or adjacent spaces are not part of the escape route.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Pipes and hydrants</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.1 Materials readily rendered ineffective by heat shall not be used for fire mains and hydrants unless adequately protected. The pipes and hydrants shall be so placed that the fire hoses may be easily coupled to them. The arrangement of pipes and hydrants shall be such as to avoid the possibility of freezing. In ships where deck cargo may be carried, the positions of the hydrants shall be such that they are always readily accessible and the pipes shall bear ranged as far as practicable to avoid risk of damage by such cargo. Unless one hose and nozzle is provided for each hydrant in the ship, there shall be complete interchangeability of hose couplings and nozzles.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.2 A valve shall be fitted to serve each fire hose so that any fire hose may be removed while the fire pumps are at work.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.3 Isolating valves to separate the section of the fire main within the machinery space containing the main fire pump or pumps from the rest of the fire main shall be fitted in an easily accessible and tenable position outside the machinery spaces. The fire main shall be so arranged that when the isolating valves are shut all the hydrants on the ship, except those in the machinery space referred to above, can be supplied with water by a fire pump not located in this machinery space through pipes which do not enter this space. Exceptionally, the Administration may permit short lengths of the emergency fire pump suction and discharge piping to penetrate the machinery space if it is impracticable to route it externally provided that the integrity of the fire main is maintained by the enclosure of the piping in a substantial steel casing. 4,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards 0.31 N/mm² 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards but under 4,000 tons gross tonnage 0.27 N/mm² Under 1,000 tons gross tonnage To the satisfaction of the Administration 6,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards 0.27 N/mm² 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards but under 6,000 tons gross tonnage 0.25 N/mm² Under 1,000 tons gross tonnage To the satisfaction of the Administration</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Fire hoses</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7.1 Fire hoses shall be of material approved by the Administration and shall be sufficient in length to project a jet of water to any of the spaces in which they may be required to be used. Their maximum length shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration. Each hose shall be provided with a nozzle and the necessary couplings. Hoses specified in this Chapter as "fire hoses" shall together with any necessary fittings and tools be kept ready for use in conspicuous positions near the water service hydrants or connections. Additionally in interior locations in passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers fire hoses shall be connected to the hydrants at all times.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7.2 Ships shall be provided with fire hoses the number and diameter of which shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7.3 In passenger ships there shall be at least one fire hose for each of the hydrants required by paragraph 5 and these hoses shall be used only for the purposes of extinguishing fires or testing the fire-extinguishing apparatus at fire drills and surveys.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7.4.1 In cargo ships of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards the number of fire hoses to be provided shall be one for each 30 m length of the ship and one spare but in no case less than five in all. This number does not include any hoses required in any engine or boiler room. The Administration may increase the number of hoses required so as to ensure that hoses in sufficient number are available and accessible at all times, having regard to the type of ship and the nature of trade in which the ship is employed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7.4.2 In cargo ships of less than 1,000 tons gross tonnage the number of fire hoses to be provided shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 Nozzles</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>8.1 For the purposes of this Chapter, standard nozzle sizes shall be 12mm, 16mmand 19mm or as near thereto as possible. Larger diameter nozzles may be permitted at the discretion of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>8.2 For accommodation and service spaces, a nozzle size greater than 12mmneed not be used.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>8.3 For machinery spaces and exterior locations, the nozzle size shall be such as to obtain the maximum discharge possible from two jets at the pressure mentioned in paragraph 4 from the smallest pump, provided that a nozzle size greater than 19mmneed not be used.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>8.4 All nozzles shall be of an approved dual purpose type (i.e.spray/jet type) incorporating a shut-off.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9 Location and arrangement of water pumps, etc., for other fire-extinguishing systems. Pumps required for the provision of water for other fire-extinguishing systems required by this Chapter, their sources of power and their controls shall be installed outside the space or spaces protected by such systems and shall be so arranged that a fire in the space or spaces protected will not put any such system out of action.</H4></BODY></HTML>
