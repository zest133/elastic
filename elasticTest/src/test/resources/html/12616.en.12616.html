<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.5 For the period of time required by Regulation 29.14 the steering gear if required to be so supplied by that Regulation.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.6 For a period of half an hour:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 any watertight doors required by Regulation 15 to be power operated together with their indicators and warning signals. Provided the requirements of Regulation 15.9.2 are complied with, sequential operation of the doors may be permitted providing all doors can be closed in 60 seconds;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 the emergency arrangements to bring the lift cars to deck level for the escape of persons. The passenger lift cars may be brought to deck level sequentially in an emergency.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.7 In a ship engaged regularly on voyages of short duration, the Administration if satisfied that an adequate standard of safety would be attained may accept a lesser period than the 36 hour period specified in paragraphs 2.1 to 2.5 but not less than 12 hours.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 The emergency source of electrical power may be either a generator or an accumulator battery, which shall comply with the following:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 Where the emergency source of electrical power is a generator, it shall be:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 driven by a suitable prime-mover with an independent supply of fuel having a flash point (closed cup test) of not less than 43°C ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 started automatically upon failure of the electrical supply from the main source of electrical power and shall be automatically connected to the emergency switchboard; those services referred to in paragraph 4 shall then be transferred automatically to the emergency generating set. The automatic starting system and the characteristic of the prime-mover shall be such as to permit the emergency generator to carry its full rated load as quickly as is safe and practicable, subject to a maximum of 45 seconds; unless a second independent means of starting the emergency generating set is provided, the single source of stored energy shall be protected to preclude its complete depletion by the automatic starting system; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 provided with a transitional source of emergency electrical power according to paragraph 4.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 Where the emergency source of electrical power is an accumulator battery, it shall be capable of:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 carrying the emergency electrical load without recharging while maintaining the voltage of the battery throughout the discharge period within 12 percent above or below its nominal voltage;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 automatically connecting to the emergency switchboard in the event of failure of the main source of electrical power; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 immediately supplying at least those services specified in paragraph 4.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 The transitional source of emergency electrical power required by paragraph 3.1.3 shall consist of an accumulator battery suitably located for use in an emergency which shall operate without recharging while maintaining the voltage of the battery throughout the discharge period within 12 percent above or below its nominal voltage and be of sufficient capacity and so arranged as to supply automatically in the event of failure of either the main or emergency source of electrical power at least the following services, if they depend upon an electrical source for their operation:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 For half an hour:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 the lighting required by paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 all services required by paragraphs 2.3.1, 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 unless such services have an independent supply for the period specified from an accumulator battery suitably located for use in an emergency.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 Power to close the watertight doors but not necessarily all of them simultaneously, together with their indicators and warning signals as required by paragraph 2.6.1.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.1 The emergency switchboard shall be installed as near as is practicable to the emergency source of electrical power.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.2 Where the emergency source of electrical power is a generator, the emergency switchboard shall be located in the same space unless the operation of the emergency switchboard would thereby be impaired.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.3 No accumulator battery fitted in accordance with this Regulation shall be installed in the same space as the emergency switchboard. An indicator shall be mounted in a suitable place on the main switchboard or in the machinery control room to indicate when the batteries constituting either the emergency source of electrical power or the transitional source of emergency electrical power referred to in paragraph 3.1.3 or 4 are being discharged.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.4 The emergency switchboard shall be supplied during normal operation from the main switchboard by an inter connector feeder which is to be adequately protected at the main switchboard against overload and short circuit and which is to be disconnected automatically at the emergency switchboard upon failure of the main source of electrical power. Where the system is arranged for feedback operation, the inter connector feeder is also to be protected at the emergency switchboard at least against short circuit.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.5 In order to ensure ready availability of the emergency source of electrical power, arrangements shall be made where necessary to disconnect automatically non-emergency circuits from the emergency switchboard to ensure that power shall be available to the emergency circuits.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 The emergency generator and its prime-mover and any emergency accumulator battery shall be so designed and arranged as to ensure that they will function at full rated power when the ship is upright and when inclined at any angle of list up to 22.5°or when inclined up to 10°either in the fore or aft direction, or is in any combination of angles within those limits.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Provision shall be made for the periodic testing of the complete emergency system and shall include the testing of automatic starting arrangements.</H4></BODY></HTML>
