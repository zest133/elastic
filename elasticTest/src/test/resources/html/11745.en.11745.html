<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to Unified interpretation of the application of regulations governed by the building contract date, the keel laying date and the delivery date for the requirements of the SOLAS and MARPOL Conventions (<A href="UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=58426&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=false">MSC-MEPC.5/Circ.8</A>)</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">1.1 Unless expressly provided otherwise, this chapter shall apply to ships the keels of which are laid or which are at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 January 2009.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">1.2 For the purpose of this chapter, the term a similar stage of construction means the stage at which:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 construction identifiable with a specific ship begins; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 assembly of that ship has commenced comprising at least 50 tonnes or one per cent of the estimated mass of all structural material, whichever is less.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">1.3 For the purpose of this chapter:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 the expression ships constructed means ships the keels of which are laid or which are at a similar stage of construction;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 the expression all ships means ships constructed before, on or after 1 January 2009;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.3 a cargo ship, whenever built, which is converted to a passenger ship shall be treated as a passenger ship constructed on the date on which such a conversion commences;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.4 the expression alterations and modifications of a major character means, in the context of cargo ship subdivision and stability, any modification to the construction which affects the level of subdivision of that ship. Where a cargo ship is subject to such modification, it shall be demonstrated that the A/R ratio calculated for the ship after such modifications is not less than the A/R ratio calculated for the ship before the modification. However, in those cases where the shipâ€™s A/R ratio before modification is equal to or greater than unity, it is only necessary that the ship after modification has an A value which is not less than R, calculated for the modified ship.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">2 Unless expressly provided otherwise, for ships constructed before 1 January 2009, the Administration shall ensure that the requirements which are applicable under chapter II-1 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended by resolutions MSC.1(XLV), MSC.6(48), MSC.11(55), MSC.12(56), MSC.13(57), MSC.19(58), MSC.26(60), MSC.27(61), Resolution 1 of the 1995 SOLAS Conference, MSC.47(66), MSC.57(67), MSC.65(68), MSC.69(69), MSC.99(73), MSC.134(76), MSC.151(78) and MSC.170(79) are complied with.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">3 All ships which undergo repairs, alterations, modifications and outfitting related thereto shall continue to comply with at least the requirements previously applicable to these ships. Such ships, if constructed before the date on which any relevant amendments enter into force, shall, as a rule, comply with the requirements for ships constructed on or after that date to at least the same extent as they did before undergoing such repairs, alterations, modifications or outfitting. Repairs, alterations and modifications of a major character and outfitting related thereto shall meet the requirements for ships constructed on or after the date on which any relevant amendments enter into force, in so far as the Administration deems reasonable and practicable. </H4>

<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">4 The Administration of a State may, if it considers that the sheltered nature and conditions of the voyage are such as to render the application of any specific requirements of this chapter unreasonable or unnecessary, exempt from those requirements individual ships or classes of ships entitled to fly the flag of that State which, in the course of their voyage, do not proceed more than 20 miles from the nearest land.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">5 In the case of passenger ships which are employed in special trades for the carriage of large numbers of special trade passengers, such as the pilgrim trade, the Administration of the State whose flag such ships are entitled to fly, if satisfied that it is impracticable to enforce compliance with the requirements of this chapter, may exempt such ships from those requirements, provided that they comply fully with the provisions of:</H4>
