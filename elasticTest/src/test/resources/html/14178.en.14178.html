<H6 class=footnote align=justify><IMG src="http://krcon.krs.co.kr/images/icon/link.gif" width=39 height=15>Refer to&nbsp;<A href="http://krcon.krs.co.kr:1004/Admin/TreeEditor/UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=59649&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=false">MSC.1/Circ.1464/Rev.1</A>&nbsp;UNIFIED INTERPRETATIONS OF SOLAS CHAPTERS II-1 AND XII, OF THE TECHNICAL PROVISIONS FOR MEANS OF ACCESS FOR INSPECTIONS (RESOLUTION MSC.158(78)) AND OF THE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR WATER LEVEL DETECTORS ON BULK CARRIERS AND SINGLE HOLD CARGO SHIPS OTHER THAN BULK CARRIERS (RESOLUTION MSC.188(79))</H6>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>1 Emergency generating sets shall be capable of being readily started in their cold condition at a temperature of 0Â°C. If this is impracticable, or if lower temperatures are likely to be encountered, provision acceptable to the Administration shall be made for the maintenance of heating arrangements, to ensure ready starting of the generating sets.</H4>

<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 Each emergency generating set arranged to be automatically started shall be equipped with starting devices approved by the Administration with a stored energy capability of at least three consecutive starts. A second source energy shall be provided for an additional three starts within 30 min unless manual starting can be demonstrated to be affective. </H4>

<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.1 Ships constructed on or after 1 October 1994, in lieu of the provision of the second sentence of paragraph 2, shall comply with the following requirements:</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>The source of stored energy shall be protected to preclude critical depletion by the automatic starting system, unless a second independent means of starting is provided. In addition, a second source of energy shall be provided for an additional three starts within 30 minutes unless manual starting can be demonstrated to be effective.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 The stored energy shall be maintained at all times, as follows:</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.1 electrical and hydraulic starting systems shall be maintained from the emergency switchboard;</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.2 compressed air starting systems may be maintained by the main or auxiliary compressed air receivers through a suitable non-return valve or by an emergency air compressor which, if electrically driven, is supplied from the emergency switchboard;</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.3 all of these starting, charging and energy storing devices shall be located in the emergency generator space; these devices are not to be used for any purpose other than the operation of the emergency generating set. This does not preclude the supply to the air receiver of the emergency generating set from the main or auxiliary compressed air system through the non-return valve fitted in the emergency generator space.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4.1 Where automatic starting is not required, manual starting is permissible, such as manual cranking, inertia starters, manually charged hydraulic accumulators, or powder charge cartridges, where they can be demonstrated as being effective.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4.2 When manual starting is not practicable, the requirements of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be complied with except that starting may be manually initiated.</H4></BODY></HTML>
