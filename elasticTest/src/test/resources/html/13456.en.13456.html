<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) If a certificate other than a Passenger Ship Safety Certificate is issued for a period of less than five years, the Administration may extend the validity of the certificate beyond the expiry date to the maximum period specified in paragraph (a), provided that the surveys referred to in regulations 8, 9 and 10 applicable when a certificate is issued for a period of 5 years are carried out as appropriate.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) If a renewal survey has been completed and a new certificate cannot be issued or placed on board the ship before the expiry date of the existing certificate, the person or organization authorized by the Administration may endorse the existing certificate and such a certificate shall be accepted as valid for a further period which shall not exceed 5 months from the expiry date.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) If a ship at the time when a certificate expires is not in a port in which it is to be surveyed, the Administration may extend the period of validity of the certificate but this extension shall be granted only for the purpose of allowing the ship to complete its voyage to the port in which it is to be surveyed, and then only in cases where it appears proper and reasonable to do so. No certificate shall be extended for a period longer than three months, and a ship to which an extension is granted shall not, on its arrival in the port in which it is to be surveyed, be entitled by virtue of such extension to leave that port without having a new certificate. When the renewal survey is completed, the new certificate shall be valid to:</H4>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) A certificate issued to a ship engaged on short voyages which has not been extended under the foregoing provisions of this regulation may be extended by the Administration for a period of grace of up to one month from the date of expiry stated on it.

<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) for a passenger ship, a date not exceeding 12 months from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) for a cargo ship, a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) In special circumstances, as determined by the Administration, a new certificate need not be dated from the date of expiry of the existing certificate as required by paragraphs (b) (ii), (e) or (f) In these special circumstances, the new certificate shall be valid to:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) for a passenger ship, a date not exceeding 12 months from the date of completion of the renewal survey;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) for a cargo ship, a date not exceeding five years from the date of completion of the renewal survey.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) If an annual, intermediate or periodical survey is completed before the period specified in the relevant regulations then:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) the anniversary date shown on the relevant certificate shall be amended by endorsement to a date which shall not be more than three months later than the date on which the survey was completed;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) the subsequent annual, intermediate or periodical survey required by the relevant regulations shall be completed at the intervals prescribed by these regulations using the new anniversary date;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) the expiry date may remain unchanged provided one or more annual, intermediate or periodical surveys, as appropriate, are carried out so that the maximum intervals between the surveys prescribed by the relevant regulations are not exceeded.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(i) A certificate issued under regulation 12 or 13 shall cease to be valid in any of the following case:</H4>

<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) if the certificate is not endorsed in accordance with the present regulations;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) upon transfer of the ship to the flag of another State. A new certificate shall only be issued when the Government issuing the new certificate is fully satisfied that the ship is in compliance with the requirements of regulation 11 (a) and (b). In the case of a transfer between Contracting Governments, if requested within three months after the transfer has taken place, the Government of the State whose flag the ship was formerly entitled to fly shall, as soon as possible, transmit to the Administration copies of the certificates carried by the ship before the transfer and, if available, copies of the relevant survey reports.</H5>
