<H3 class=regulation align=center>Survival craft emergency position-indicating beacons</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Survival craft emergency position-indicating radio beacons required by regulation III/6.2.3 to be carried in survival craft shall provide transmissions to enable aircraft to locate the survival craft and may also provide transmissions for alerting purposes.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Survival craft emergency position-indicating radio beacons shall, at least, be capable of transmitting alternately or simultaneously signals complying with the relevant standards and recommended practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on the frequencies 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Survival craft emergency position-indicating radio beacons shall:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) be of a highly visible colour, so designed that they can be used by an unskilled person and so constructed that they may be easily tested and maintained. Batteries shall not require replacement at intervals of less than 12 months, taking into account testing arrangements;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) be watertight, capable of floating and being dropped into the water without damage from a height of at least 20 m;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) be capable only of manual activation and de-activation;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) be portable, lightweight, and compact;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(v) be provided with an indication that signals are being emitted;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vi) derive their energy supply from a battery forming a integral part of the device and having sufficient capacity to operate the apparatus for a period of 48 h. The transmission may be intermittent. Determination of the duty cycle should take into account the probability of homing being properly carried out, the need to avoid congestion on the frequencies and the need to comply with the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vii) be tested and, if necessary, have their source of energy replaced at intervals not exceeding 12 months. </H5></BODY></HTML>
