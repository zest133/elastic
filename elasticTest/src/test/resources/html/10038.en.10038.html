<H3 class=regulation align=center>Main Vertical Zones</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The hull, superstructure and deckhouses shall be subdivided into main vertical zones. Steps and recesses shall be kept to a minimum, but where they are necessary, they shall be of "A" Class divisions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) As far as practicable, the bulkheads forming the boundaries of the main vertical zones above the bulkhead deck shall be in line with watertight subdivision bulkheads situated immediately below the bulkhead deck.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Such bulkheads shall extend from deck to deck and to the shell or other boundaries.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) On ships designed for special purposes, such as automobile or railroad car ferries, where installation of such bulkheads would defeat the purpose for which the ship is intended, equivalent means for controlling and limiting a fire shall be substituted and specifically approved by the Administration.</H4></BODY></HTML>
