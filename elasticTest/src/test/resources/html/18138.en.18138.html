<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 On bulk carriers, the means for draining and pumping ballast tanks forward of the collision bulkhead and bilges of dry spaces any part of which extends forward of the foremost cargo hold shall be capable of being brought into operation from a readily accessible enclosed space, the location of which is accessible from the navigation bridge or propulsion machinery control position without traversing exposed freeboard or superstructure decks. Where pipes serving such tanks or bilges pierce the collision bulkhead, valve operation by means of remotely operated actuators may be accepted, as an alternative to the valve control specified in regulation II-1/11.4, provided that the location of such valve controls complies with this regulation.&nbsp; <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=25873&amp;localekey=en"><IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 179</A></H4>
