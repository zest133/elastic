<H3 class=regulation align=center>Principles relating to bridge design, design and arrangement of navigational systems and equipment and bridge procedures</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>All decisions which are made for the purpose of applying the requirements of regulations 19, 22, 24, 25, 27, and 28 of this chapter and which affect bridge design, the design and arrangement of navigational systems and equipment on the bridge and bridge procedures** shall be taken with the aim of:</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>** Refer to Guidelines on ergonomic criteria for bridge equipment and layout (<A href="UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=12811&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=false">MSC/Circ.982</A>) and Guidelines for bridge equipment and systems, their arrangement and integration (BES) (SN.1/Circ.288) and, for INS, to Recommendation on performance standards for an integrated navigational system (<A href="UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=7513&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=true">resolution MSC.86(70)</A>, annex 3, as amended).</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 facilitating the tasks to be performed by the bridge team and the pilot in making full appraisal of the situation and in navigating the ship safely under all operational conditions;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 promoting effective and safe bridge resource management;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 enabling the bridge team and the pilot to have convenient and continuous access to essential information which is presented in a clear and unambiguous manner, using standardized symbols and coding systems for controls and displays;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 indicating the operational status of automated functions and integrated components, systems and/or sub-systems;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 allowing for expeditious, continuous and effective information processing and decision-making by the bridge team and the pilot;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 preventing or minimizing excessive or unnecessary work and any conditions or distractions on the bridge which may cause fatigue or interfere with the vigilance of the bridge team and the pilot; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.7 minimizing the risk of human error and detecting such error if it occurs, through monitoring and alarm systems, in time for the bridge team and the pilot to take appropriate action.</H5></BODY></HTML>
