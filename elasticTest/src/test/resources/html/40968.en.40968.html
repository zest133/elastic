<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation><U>Goal-based ship construction standards for bulk carriers and oil tankers</U></H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle><U>1 This regulation shall apply to oil tankers of 150 m in length and above and to bulk carriers of 150 m in length and above, constructed with single deck, top-side tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces, excluding ore carriers and combination carriers:</U></H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1><U>.1 for which the building contract is placed on or after 1 July 2016;</U></H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1><U>.2 in the absence of a building contract, the keels of which are laid or which are at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 July 2017; or</U></H5>

<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle><U>2 Ships shall be designed and constructed for a specified design life to be safe and environmentally friendly, when properly operated and maintained under the specified operating and environmental conditions, in intact and specified damage conditions, throughout their life.</U></H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1><U>2.1 Safe and environmentally friendly means the ship shall have adequate strength, integrity and stability to minimize the risk of loss of the ship or pollution to the marine environment due to structural failure, including collapse, resulting in flooding or loss of watertight integrity.</U></H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify><U>2.2 Environmentally friendly also includes the ship being constructed of materials for environmentally acceptable recycling.</U></H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify><U>2.3 Safety also includes the ship's structure, fittings and arrangements providing for safe access, escape, inspection and proper maintenance and facilitating safe operation.</U></H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify><U>2.4 Specified operating and environmental conditions are defined by the intended operating area for the ship throughout its life and cover the conditions, including intermediate conditions, arising from cargo and ballast operations in port, waterways and at sea.</U></H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify><U>2.5 Specified design life is the nominal period that the ship is assumed to be exposed to operating and/or environmental conditions and/or the corrosive environment and is used for selecting appropriate ship design parameters. However, the ship's actual service life may be longer or shorter depending on the actual operating conditions and maintenance of the ship throughout its life cycle.</U></H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left><U>3 The requirements of paragraphs 2 to 2.5 shall be achieved through satisfying applicable structural requirements of an organization which is recognized by the Administration in accordance with the provisions of regulation XI-1/1, or national standards of the Administration, conforming to the functional requirements of the Goal-based Ship Construction Standards for Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers.</U></H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left><U>4 A Ship Construction File with specific information on how the functional requirements of the Goal-based Ship Construction Standards for Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers have been applied in the ship design and construction shall be provided upon delivery of a new ship, and kept on board the ship and/or ashore* and updated as appropriate throughout the ship's service. The contents of the Ship Construction File shall, at least, conform to the guidelines developed by the Organization.*</U></H4>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=footnote><U>* Refer to the Guidelines for the information to be included in a Ship Construction File</U> (<A href="/CONTENTS.ASPX?CategoryID=51733">MSC.1/Circ.1343</A>).</H6></BODY></HTML>
