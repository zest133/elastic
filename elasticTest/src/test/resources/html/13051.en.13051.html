<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 Falls shall be of rotation-resistant and corrosion-resistant steel wire rope.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 In the case of a multiple drum winch, unless an efficient compensatory device is fitted, the falls shall be so arranged as to wind off the drums at the same rate when lowering, and to wind on to the drums evenly at the same rate when hoisting.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3 Every rescue boat launching appliance shall be fitted with a powered winch motor of such capacity that the rescue boat can be raised from the water with its full complement of persons and equipment.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.4 An efficient hand gear shall be provided for recovery of each survival craft and rescue boat. Hand gear handles or wheels shall not be rotated by moving parts of the winch when the survival craft or rescue boat is being lowered or when it is being hoisted by power.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.5 Where davit arms are recovered by power, safety devices shall be fitted which will automatically cut off the power before the davit arms reach the stops in order to avoid overstressing the falls or davits, unless the motor is designed to prevent such overstressing.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.6 The speed at which the survival craft or rescue boat is lowered into the water shall be not less than that obtained from the formula:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>S = 0.4 + (0.02 × H)</H6><BR>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>where S = speed of lowering in metres per second</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>and H = height in metres from davit head to the waterline at the lightest seagoing condition.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.7 The maximum lowering speed shall be established by the Administration having regard to the design of the survival craft or rescue boat, the protection of its occupants from excessive forces, and the strength of the launching arrangements taking into account inertia forces during an emergency stop. Means shall be incorporated in the appliance to ensure that this speed is not exceeded.</H5>
