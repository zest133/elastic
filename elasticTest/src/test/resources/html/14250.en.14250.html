<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fire patrols, detection, alarms and public address systems</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(Paragraph 2 of this regulation applies to ships constructed on or after 1 February 1992).</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(Paragraph 7 applies to ships&nbsp;constructed&nbsp;on or after 1 January 1994).</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Manually operated call points complying with the requirements of regulation 13 shall be installed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 A fixed fire detection and fire alarm system complying with the requirements of regulation 13 or a sample extraction smoke detection system complying with the requirements of regulation 13-1 shall be provided in any cargo space which, in the opinion of the Administration, is not accessible, except where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that the ship is engaged on voyages of such short duration that it would be unreasonable to apply this requirement.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 All ships shall at all times when at sea, or in port (except when out of service), be so manned or equipped as to ensure that any initial fire alarm is immediately received by a responsible member of the crew.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 A special alarm, operated from the navigating bridge or fire control station, shall be fitted to summon the crew. This alarm may be part of the ship's general alarm system but it shall be capable of being sounded independently of the alarm to the passenger spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 A public address system or other effective means of communication shall be available throughout the accommodation and service spaces and control stations and open decks. Each member of the fire patrol shall be provided with a two-way portable radio telephone apparatus.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 For ships carrying more than 36 passengers an efficient patrol system shall be maintained so that an outbreak of fire may be promptly detected. Each member of the fire patrol shall be trained to be familiar with the arrangements of the ship as well as the location and operation of any equipment he may be called upon to use.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Where public spaces span three or more open decks and contain combustibles such as furniture and enclosed spaces such as shops, offices and restaurants, the entire main vertical zone containing the space shall be protected throughout with a smoke detection system complying with regulation 13, with the exception of paragraph 1.9.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7.1 Passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers shall have the detection alarms for the systems required by regulation 36.2 centralized in a continuously manned central control station. In addition, controls for remote closing of the fire doors and shutting down the ventilation fans, shall be centralized in the same location. The ventilation fans shall be capable of reactivation by the crew at the continuously manned control station. The control panels in the central control station shall be capable of indicating open or closed positions of fire doors, closed or off status of the detectors, alarms and fans. The control panel shall be continuously powered and should have an automatic change-over to standby power supply in case of loss of normal power supply. The control panel shall be powered from the main source of electrical power and the emergency source of electrical power defined by regulation II-1/42 unless other arrangements are permitted by the regulations, as applicable.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7.2 The control panel shall be designed on the fail-safe principle, e.g. an open detector circuit shall cause an alarm condition, as noted in regulations II-2/13.1.3 and II-1/51.1.4.</H5>
