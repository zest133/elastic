<H3 class=regulation align=center>Section II - ASSUMED VOLUMETRIC HEELING MOMENT OF A FILLED COMPARTMENT</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>(A) GENERAL</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The pattern of grain surface movement relates to a transverse section across the portion of the compartment being considered and the resultant heeling moment should be multiplied by the length to obtain the total moment for that portion.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The assumed transverse heeling moment due to grain shifting is a consequence of final changes of shape and position of voids after grain has moved from the high side to the low side.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The resulting grain surface after shifting shall be assumed to be at 15 degrees to the horizontal.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) In calculating the maximum void area that can be formed against a longitudinal structural member, the effects of any horizontal surfaces, e.g. flanges or face bars, shall be ignored.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) The total areas of the initial and final voids shall be equal.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) A discontinuous longitudinal division shall be considered effective over its full length.</H4></BODY></HTML>
