<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>5.3 Cargo tank venting</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>5.3.1 General requirements </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>The venting systems of cargo tanks are to be entirely distinct from the air pipes of the other compartments of the ship. The arrangements and position of openings in the cargo tank deck from which emission of flammable vapours can occur shall be such as to minimize the possibility of flammable vapours being admitted to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition, or collecting in the vicinity of deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard. In accordance with this general principle, the criteria in paragraphs 5.3.2 to 5.3.5 and regulation 11.6 will apply. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>5.3.2 Venting arrangements </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>5.3.2.1 The venting arrangements in each cargo tank may be independent or combined with other cargo tanks and may be incorporated into the inert gas piping. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>5.3.2.2 Where the arrangements are combined with other cargo tanks, either stop valves or other acceptable means shall be provided to isolate each cargo tank. Where stop valves are fitted, they shall be provided with locking arrangements which shall be under the control of the responsible ship's officer. There shall be a clear visual indication of the operational status of the valves or other acceptable means. Where tanks have been isolated, it shall be ensured that relevant isolating valves are opened before cargo loading or ballasting or discharging of those tanks is commenced. <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=244&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 140</A></H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>Any isolation must continue to permit the flow caused by thermal variations in a cargo tank in accordance with regulation 11.6.1.1. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>5.3.2.3 If cargo loading and ballasting or discharging of a cargo tank or cargo tank group is intended, which is isolated from a common venting system, that cargo tank or cargo tank group shall be fitted with a means for over-pressure or under-pressure protection as required in regulation 11.6.3.2. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>5.3.2.4 The venting arrangements shall be connected to the top of each cargo tank and shall be self-draining to the cargo tanks under all normal conditions of trim and list of the ship. Where it may not be possible to provide self-draining lines, permanent arrangements shall be provided to drain the vent lines to a cargo tank. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>5.3.3 Safety devices in venting systems&nbsp; <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=25867&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 173</A></H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>The venting system shall be provided with devices to prevent the passage of flame into the cargo tanks. The design, testing and locating of these devices shall comply with the requirements established by the Administration based on the guidelines developed by the Organization.* Ullage openings shall not be used for pressure equalization. They shall be provided with self-closing and tightly sealing covers. Flame arresters and screens are not permitted in these openings. </H6>

<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>5.3.4 Vent outlets for cargo handling and ballasting </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>5.3.4.1 Vent outlets for cargo loading, discharging and ballasting required by regulation 11.6.1.2 shall:</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>.1.1 permit the free flow of vapour mixtures; or </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>.1.2 permit the throttling of the discharge of the vapour mixtures to achieve a velocity of not less than 30 m/s; </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>.2 be so arranged that the vapour mixture is discharged vertically upwards; </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>.3 where the method is by free flow of vapour mixtures, be such that the outlet shall be not less than 6 m above the cargo tank deck or fore and aft gangway if situated within 4 m of the gangway and located not less than 10 m measured horizontally from the nearest air intakes and openings to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition and from deck machinery, which may include anchor windlass and chain locker openings, and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard; and&nbsp; <IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">&nbsp;<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=161&amp;localekey=en">IACS UI SC 57</A></H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>.4 where the method is by high-velocity discharge, be located at a height not less than 2 m above the cargo tank deck and not less than 10 m measured horizontally from the nearest air intakes and openings to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition and from deck machinery, which may include anchor windlass and chain locker openings, and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard. These outlets shall be provided with high velocity devices of an approved type.&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">&nbsp;<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=161&amp;localekey=en">IACS UI SC 57</A></H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>5.3.4.2 The arrangements for the venting of vapours displaced from the cargo tanks during loading and ballasting shall comply with paragraph 5.3 and regulation 11.6 and shall consist of either one or more mast risers, or a number of high-velocity vents. The inert gas supply main may be used for such venting. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>5.3.5 Isolation of slop tanks in combination carriers </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>In combination carriers, the arrangements for isolating slop tanks containing oil or oil residues from other cargo tanks shall consist of blank flanges which will remain in position at all times when cargoes other than liquid cargoes referred to in regulation 1.6.1 are carried. </H6></BODY></HTML>
