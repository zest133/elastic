<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4.4 Only public toilets, lifts, lockers of non-combustible materials providing storage for safety equipment and open information counters may be located within the stairway enclosure boundaries. Other existing spaces within the stairway enclosure:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 shall be emptied, permanently closed and disconnected from the electrical system; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 shall be separated from the stairway enclosure by the provision of "A" class divisions in accordance with regulation 26. Such spaces may have direct access to stairway enclosures by the provision of "A" class doors in accordance with regulation 26, and subject to a sprinkler system being provided in these spaces. However, cabins shall not directly open into the stairway enclosure.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4.5 Spaces other than public spaces, corridors, public toilets, special category spaces, other stairways required by regulation 28.1.5, open deck spaces and spaces covered by paragraph 4.4.2 are not permitted to have direct access to stairway enclosures.</H4>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4.7 In addition to the emergency lighting required by regulations II-1/42 and III/11.5, the means of escape including stairways and exits shall be marked, at all points of the escape route including angles and intersections, by lighting or photoluminescent strip indicators placed not more than 0.3m above the deck. The marking must enable passengers to identify all routes of escape and readily identify the escape exits. If electric illumination is used, it shall be supplied by the emergency source of power and it shall be so arranged that the failure of any single light, or cut in a lighting strip, will not result in the marking being ineffective. Additionally, all escape route signs and fire equipment location markings shall be of photoluminescent material. The Administration shall ensure that such lighting or photoluminescent equipment has been evaluated, tested and applied in accordance with the guidelines developed by the Organization*.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Guidelines for the evaluation, testing and application of low-location lighting on passenger ship adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7243&amp;localekey=en">A.752(18).</A></H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4.8 A general emergency alarm system shall be provided.

The Administration may permit additional seating in the main reception area within stairway enclosures, if it is fixed, non-combustible, and does not restrict the passenger escape route. Furniture shall not be permitted in passenger and crew corridors forming escape routes in cabin areas. In addition to the above, lockers of non-combustible material, providing storage for safety equipment required by regulations, may be permitted.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Accommodation and service spaces, stairway enclosures and corridors shall be fitted with an automatic sprinkler, fire detection and fire alarm system complying with the requirements of regulation 12 or the guidelines developed by the Organization* for an approved equivalent sprinkler system. A sprinkler system need not be fitted in private bathrooms and spaces having little or no fire risk such as voids and similar spaces.(<IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">&nbsp;Refer to <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=234&amp;localekey=en">IACS UI SC130</A>)</H4>

<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 a stairway connecting only two decks need not be enclosed, provided the integrity of the deck is maintained by proper bulkheads or doors in one 'tween-deck space. When a stairway is closed in one 'tween-deck space, the stairway enclosure shall be protected in accordance with the tables for decks in regulation 26;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 stairways may be fitted in the open in a public space, provided they lie wholly within such public space.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.2 Machinery spaces of category A shall be fitted with a fixed fire-extinguishing system complying with the requirements of regulation 7.</H4>

In addition, fail-safe automatic closing fire dampers with manual operation from within the enclosure shall be fitted to all ventilation ducts serving both accommodation and service spaces and stairway enclosures where they pierce such enclosures. Ventilation ducts passing through a main fire zone division without serving spaces on both sides or passing through a stairway enclosure without serving that enclosure need not be fitted with dampers provided that the ducts are constructed and insulated to A-60 standard and have no openings within the stairway enclosure or in the trunk on the side which is not directly served.</H4>
