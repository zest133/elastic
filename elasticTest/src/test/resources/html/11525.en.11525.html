<H3 class=regulation align=center>Inspection and Survey</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The inspection and survey of ships, so far as regards the enforcement of the provisions of the present Regulations and the granting of exemptions therefrom, shall be carried out by officers of the Administration. The Administration may, however, entrust the inspections and surveys either to surveyors nominated for the purpose or to organizations recognized by it.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The Administration shall institute arrangements for unscheduled inspections to be carried out during the period of validity of the certificate. Such inspections shall ensure that the ship and its equipment remain in all respects satisfactory for the service for which the ship is intended. These inspections may be carried out by the Administration's own inspection services, or by nominated surveyors, or by recognized organizations, or by other Parties upon request of the Administration. Where the Administration, under the provisions of Regulations 8 and 10 of this Chapter, establishes mandatory annual surveys, the above unscheduled inspections shall not be obligatory.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) An Administration nominating surveyors or recognizing organizations to conduct inspections and surveys as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Reg. shall as a minimum empower any nominated surveyor or recognized organization to:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) require repairs to a ship, and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) carry out inspections and surveys if requested by the appropriate authorities of a Port State.</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>The Administration shall notify the Organization of the specific responsibilities and conditions of the authority delegated to nominated surveyors or recognized organizations.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) When a nominated surveyor or recognized organization determines that the condition of the ship or its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the certificate or is such that the ship is not fit to proceed to sea without danger to the ship, or persons on board, such surveyor or organization shall immediately ensure that corrective action is taken and shall in due course notify the Administration. If such corrective action is not taken the relevant certificate should be withdrawn and the Administration shall be notified immediately; and, if the ship is in the port of another Party, the appropriate authorities of the Port State shall also be notified immediately. When an officer of the Administration, a nominated surveyor or recognized organization has notified the appropriate authorities of the Port State, the Government of the Port State concerned shall give such officer, surveyor or organization any necessary assistance to carry out their obligations under this Regulation. When applicable, the Government of the Port State concerned shall ensure that the ship shall not sail until it can proceed to sea, or leave port for the purpose of proceeding to the appropriate repair yard, without danger to the ship or persons on board.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) In every case, the Administration shall fully guarantee the completeness and efficiency of the inspection and survey, and shall undertake to ensure the necessary arrangements to satisfy this obligation.</H4></BODY></HTML>
