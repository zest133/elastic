<H3 class=regulation align=center>Stowage of bulk cargo</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Bulk cargoes shall be loaded and trimmed reasonably level, as necessary, to the boundaries of the cargo space so as to minimize the risk of shifting and to ensure that adequate stability will be maintained throughout the voyage.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 When bulk cargoes are carried in 'tween-decks, the hatchways of such 'tween-decks shall be closed in those cases where the loading information indicates an unacceptable level of stress of the bottom structure if the hatchways are left open. The cargo shall be trimmed reasonably level and shall either extend from side to side or be secured by additional longitudinal divisions of sufficient strength. The safe load-carrying capacity of the 'tween-decks shall be observed to ensure that the deck-structure is not overloaded.</H4>
