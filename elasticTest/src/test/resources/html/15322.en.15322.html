<H3 class=regulation align=center>Navigation bridge visibility</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Ships of not less than 45 m in length as defined in regulation III/3.12, constructed on or after 1 July 1998, shall meet the following requirements:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 The view of the sea surface from the conning position shall not be obscured by more than two ship lengths, or 500 m, whichever is the less, forward of the bow to 10Â° on either side under all conditions of draught, trim and deck cargo;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 No blind sector caused by cargo, cargo gear or other obstructions outside of the wheelhouse forward of the beam which obstructs the view of the sea surface as seen from the conning position, shall exceed 10 degrees. The total arc of blind sectors shall not exceed 20 degrees. The clear sectors between blind sectors shall be at least 5 degrees. However, in the view described in .1, each individual blind sector shall not exceed 5 degrees;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 The horizontal field of vision from the conning position shall extend over an arc of not less than 225 degrees that is from right ahead to not less than 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on either side of the ship;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 From each bridge wing the horizontal field of vision shall extend over an arc at least 225 degrees that is from at least 45 degrees on the opposite bow through right ahead and then from right ahead to right astern through 180 degrees on the same side of the ship;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 From the main steering position the horizontal field of vision shall extend over an arc from right ahead to at least 60 degrees on each side of the ship;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 The ship's side shall be visible from the bridge wing;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.7 The height of the lower edge of the navigation bridge front windows above the bridgedeck shall be kept as low as possible. In no case shall the lower edge present an obstruction to the forward view as described in this regulation;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.8 The upper edge of the navigation bridge front windows shall allow a forward view of the horizon, for a person with a height of eye of 1,800 mm above the bridge deck at the conning position, when the ship is pitching in heavy seas. The Administration, if satisfied that a 1,800 mm height of eye is unreasonable and impractical, may allow reduction of the height of eye but not less than 1,600 mm;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.9 Windows shall meet the following requirements:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.9.1 To help avoid reflections, the bridge front windows shall be inclined from the vertical plane top out, at an angle of not less than 10 degrees and not more than 25 degrees;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.9.2 Framing between navigation bridge windows shall be kept to a minimum and not be installed immediately forward of any work station.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.9.3 Polarized and tinted windows shall not be fitted.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.9.4 A clear view through at least two of the navigation bridge front windows and, depending on the bridge configuration, an additional number of clear-view windows shall be provided at all times, regardless of weather conditions.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Ships constructed before 1 July 1998 shall, where practicable, meet the requirements of paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2. However, structural alterations or additional equipment need not be required.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 On ships of unconventional design which, in the opinion of the Administration, cannot comply with this regulation, arrangements shall be provided to achieve a level of visibility that is as near as practical to that prescribed in this regulation.</H4>
