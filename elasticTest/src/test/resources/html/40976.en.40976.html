<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>5.7.2 Arrangements for gas measurement in double-hull spaces and double-bottom spaces</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>5.7.2.1 Suitable portable instruments for measuring oxygen and flammable vapour concentrations in double-hull spaces and double-bottom spaces shall be provided. In selecting these instruments, due attention shall be given to their use in combination with the fixed gas sampling line systems referred to in paragraph 5.7.2.2.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>5.7.2.2 Where the atmosphere in double-hull spaces cannot be reliably measured using flexible gas sampling hoses, such spaces shall be fitted with permanent gas sampling lines. The configuration of gas sampling lines shall be adapted to the design of such spaces.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>5.7.2.3 The materials of construction and dimensions of gas sampling lines shall be such as to prevent restriction. Where plastic materials are used, they shall be electrically conductive.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>5.7.3 Arrangements for fixed hydrocarbon gas detection systems in double-hull and double-bottom spaces of oil tankers</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>5.7.3.1 In addition to the requirements in paragraphs 5.7.1 and 5.7.2, oil tankers of 20,000 tonnes deadweight and above, constructed on or after 1 January 2012, shall be provided with a fixed hydrocarbon gas detection system complying with the Fire Safety Systems Code for measuring hydrocarbon gas concentrations in all ballast tanks and void spaces of double-hull and double-bottom spaces adjacent to the cargo tanks, including the forepeak tank and any other tanks and spaces under the bulkhead deck adjacent to cargo tanks.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>5.7.3.2 Oil tankers provided with constant operative inerting systems for such spaces need not be equipped with fixed hydrocarbon gas detection equipment.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>5.7.3.3 Notwithstanding the above, cargo pump-rooms subject to the provisions of paragraph 5.10 need not comply with the requirements of this paragraph.</U></H6>
