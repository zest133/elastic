    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">1 Requirements applicable to all ro-ro passenger ship</H4>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.1 This paragraph shall apply to all ro-ro passenger ships. For ships constructed before 1 July 1997 the requirements of the regulation shall apply not later than the date of the first periodical survey after 1 July 1997.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.2 Handrails or other handholds shall be provided in all corridors along the entire scape route, so that a firm handhold is available every step of the way, where possible, to the assembly stations and embarkation stations. Such handrails shall be provided on both sides of longitudinal corridors more than 1.8m in width and transverse corridors more than 1m in width. Particular attention shall be paid to the need to be able to cross lobbies, atriums and other large open spaces along escape routes. Handrails and other handholds shall be of such strength as to withstand a distributed horizontal load of 750 N/m applied in the direction of the centre of the corridor or space, and a distributed vertical load of 750 N/m applied in the downward direction. The two loads need not be applied simultaneously.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.3 Escape routes shall not be obstructed by furniture and other obstructions. With the exception of tables and chairs which may be cleared to provide open space, cabinets and other heavy furnishings in public spaces and along escape routes shall be secured in place to prevent shifting if the ship rolls or lists. Floors coverings shall also be secured in place. When the ship is underway, escape routes shall be kept clear of obstructions such as cleaning carts, bedding, luggage and boxed of goods.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.4 Escape routes shall be provided from every normally occupied space in the ship to an assembly station. These escape routes shall be arranged so as to provide the most direct route possible to the assembly station, and shall be marked with symbols in accordance with the recommendations of the Organization.*</H5>
    <H6 CLASS="footnote" ALIGN="justify">* Refer to Symbols related to life-saving appliances and arrangements, adopted by the Organization by resolution A.760(18)</H6>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.5 Where enclosed spaces adjoin an open deck, openings from the enclosed space to the open deck shall, where practicable, be capable of being used as an emergency exit.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.6 Decks shall be sequentially numbered, starting with "1" at the tank top or lowest deck. These numbers shall be prominently displayed at stair landings and lift lobbies. Decks may also be named, but the deck number shall always be displayed with the name.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.7 Simple "mimic" plans showing the "you are here" position and escape routes marked by arrows, shall be prominently displayed on the inside of each cabin door and in public spaces. The plan shall show the directions of escape, and shall be properly oriented in relation to its position on the ship.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.8 Cabin and stateroom doors shall not require keys to unlock them from inside the room. Neither shall there be any doors along any designed escape route which require keys to unlock them when moving in the direction of escape.</H5>
    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">2 Requirements applicable to ro-ro passenger ships constructed on or after 1 July 1997</H4>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">2.1 The lowest 0.5 m of bulkheads and other partitions forming vertical divisions along escape routes shall be able to sustain a load of 750 N/m to allow them to be used as walking surfaces from the side of the escape route with the ship at large angles of heel.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">2.2 The escape route from cabins to stairway enclosures shall be as direct as possible, with a minimum number of changes in direction. It shall not be necessary to cross from one side of the ship to the other to reach an escape route. It shall not be necessary to climb more than two decks up or down in order to reach an assembly station or open deck from any passenger space.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">2.3 External routes shall be provided from open decks, referred to in paragraph 2.2, to the survival craft embarkation stations.</H5>
    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">3 Requirements applicable to ro-ro passenger ships constructed on or after 1 July 1999 For ro-ro passenger ships constructed on or after 1 July 1999, escape routes shall be evaluated by an evacuation analysis early in the design process. The analysis shall be used to identify and eliminate, as far as practicable, congestion which may develop during an abandonment, due to normal movement of passengers and crew along escape routes, including the possibility that crew may need to move along these routes in a direction opposite the movement of passengers. In addition, the analysis shall be used to demonstrate that escape arrangements are sufficiently flexible to provide for the possibility that certain escape routes, assembly stations, embarkation stations or survival craft may not be available as a result of a casualty.</H4>
