<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7.4 Ventilation systems for passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers </H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>7.4.1 The ventilation system of a passenger ship carrying more than 36 passengers shall be in compliance with the following additional requirements. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>7.4.2 In general, the ventilation fans shall be so disposed that the ducts reaching the various spaces remain within the main vertical zone. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>7.4.3 Where ventilation systems penetrate decks, precautions shall be taken, in addition to those relating to the fire integrity of the deck required by paragraphs 3.1 and 4.1.1.5, to reduce the likelihood of smoke and hot gases passing from one 'tween-deck space to another through the system. In addition to insulation requirements contained in paragraph 7.4, vertical ducts shall, if necessary, be insulated as required by the appropriate tables 9.1 and 9.2. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>7.4.4 Except in cargo spaces, ventilation ducts shall be constructed of the following materials: </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1 ducts not less than 0.075 m² in free cross-sectional area and all vertical ducts serving more than a single 'tween-deck space shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material; </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2 ducts less than 0.075 m² in free cross-sectional area other than the vertical ducts referred to in paragraph 7.4.4.1, shall be constructed of non-combustible materials. Where such ducts penetrate "A" or "B" class division due regard shall be given to ensuring the fire integrity of the division; and </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3 short length of duct, not in general exceeding 0.02m² in free cross-sectional area nor 2 m in length, need not be non-combustible provided that all of the following conditions are met: </H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify>.3.1 the duct is constructed of a material which has low flame spread characteristics; </H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify>.3.2 the duct is used only at the terminal end of the ventilation system; and </H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify>.3.3 the duct is not located closer than 600mm measured along its length to a penetration of an "A" or "B" class division, including continuous "B" class ceilings. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>7.4.5 Stairway enclosures shall be ventilated and served by an independent fan and duct system which shall not serve any other spaces in the ventilation systems. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>7.4.6 Exhaust ducts shall be provided with hatches for inspection and cleaning. The hatches shall be located near the fire dampers. </H6>
