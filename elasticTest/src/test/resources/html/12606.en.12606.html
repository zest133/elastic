<H3 class=regulation align=center>(B) STOWAGE OF SPECIALLY SUITABLE SHIPS</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in Part B of this Chapter, bulk grain may be carried without regard to the requirements specified therein in ships which are constructed with two or more vertical or sloping grain-tight longitudinal divisions suitably disposed to limit the effect of any transverse shift of grain under the following conditions:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) as many holds and compartments as possible shall be full and trimmed full;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) for any specified arrangement of stowage the ship will not list to an angle greater than 5Â°at any stage of the voyage where:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) in holds or compartments which have been trimmed full the grain surface settled 2 per cent by volume from the original surface and shifts to an angle of 12 degrees with that surface under all boundaries of these holds and compartments which have an inclination of less than 30 degrees to the horizontal;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) in partly filled compartments or holds free grain surfaces settle and shift as in sub-paragraph (1) or to such larger angle as may be deemed necessary by the Administration, or by a Contracting Government on behalf of the Administration, and grain surfaces if overstowed, with the bulk grain levelled and topped off with bagged grain or other suitable cargo tightly stowed and extending to a height of not less than 1.22 m above the top of the bulk grain within spaces divided by a longitudinal bulkhead or shifting board, and not less than 1.52 m within spaces not so divided and the bagged grain or other suitable cargo supported on suitable platforms laid over the whole surface of the bulk grain, such platforms consisting of bearers spaced not more than 1.22 m apart and 25 mm boards laid thereon spaced not more than 0.10 m apart or of strong separation cloths with adequate overlapping, will shift to an angle of 8 degrees with the original levelled surfaces. For the purpose of this paragraph shifting boards, if fitted, will be considered to limit the transverse shift of the surface of the grain;</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) the master is provided with a grain loading plan covering the stowage arrangements to be adopted and a stability booklet, both approved by the Administration, or by a Contracting Government on behalf of the Administration, showing the stability conditions upon which the calculations given in sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph are based.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The Administration, or a Contracting Government on behalf of the Administration, shall prescribe the precautions to be taken against shifting in all other conditions of loading of ships designed in accordance with paragraph (B)(a) of this Section which meet the requirements of sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of that paragraph.</H4>
