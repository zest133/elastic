<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 37</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Protection of special category spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Provisions applicable to special category spaces whether above or below the bulkhead deck</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 General</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>1.1.1 The basic principle underlying the provisions of this Regulation is that as normal main vertical zoning may not be practicable in special category spaces, equivalent protection must be obtained in such spaces on the basis of a horizontal zone concept and by the provision of an efficient fixed fire-extinguishing system. Under this concept a horizontal zone for the purpose of this Regulation may include special category spaces on more than one deck provided that the total overall clear height for vehicles does not exceed 10 m.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>1.1.2 The requirements of Regulations 16, 18, 30 and 32 for maintaining the integrity of vertical zones shall be applied equally to decks and bulkheads forming the boundaries separating horizontal zones from each other and from the remainder of the ship.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 Structural protection</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>1.2.1 Boundary bulkheads of special category spaces shall be insulated as required for category (11) spaces in table 26.1 or in table 27.1 and the horizontal boundaries as required for category (11) spaces in table 26.3 or in table 27.2.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>1.2.2 Indicators shall be provided on the navigating bridge which shall indicate when any fire door leading to or from the special category spaces is closed.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3 Fixed fire-extinguishing system*</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Reference is made to Recommendation on Fixed Fire-Extinguishing Systems for Special Category Spaces, adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=6955&amp;localekey=en">A.123(V).</A></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>Each special category space shall be fitted with an approved fixed pressure water-spraying system for manual operation which shall protect all parts of any deck and vehicle platform in such space, provided that the Administration may permit the use of any other fixed fire-extinguishing system that has been shown by full-scale test in conditions simulating a flowing petrol fire in a special category space to be not less effective in controlling fires likely to occur in such a space.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.4 Patrols and detection</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>1.4.1 An efficient patrol system shall be maintained in special category spaces. In any such space in which the patrol is not maintained by a continuous fire watch at all times during the voyage there shall be provided a fixed fire detection and fire alarm system of an approved type complying with the requirements of regulation 13. The fixed fire detection system shall be capable of rapidly detecting the onset of fire. The spacing and location of detectors shall be tested to the satisfaction of the Administration taking into account the effects of ventilation and other relevant factors.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>1.4.2 Manually operated call points shall be provided as necessary throughout the special category spaces and one shall be placed close to each exit from such spaces.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.5 Fire-extinguishing equipment</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>There shall be provided in each special category space:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1 at least three water fog applicators;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2 one portable foam applicator unit complying with the provisions of Regulation 6.4, provided that at least two such units are available in the ship for use in such spaces; and</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3 such number of portable fire extinguishers as the Administration may deem sufficient, provided that at least one portable extinguisher is located at each access to such spaces.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.6 Ventilation system</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>1.6.1 There shall be provided an effective power ventilation system for the special category spaces sufficient to give at least 10 air changes per hour. The system for such spaces shall be entirely separated from other ventilation systems and shall be operating at all times when vehicles are in such spaces. The Administration may require an increased number of air changes when vehicles are being loaded and unloaded. Ventilation ducts serving special category spaces capable of being effectively sealed shall be separated for each such space. The system shall be capable of being controlled from a position outside such spaces.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>1.6.2 The ventilation shall be such as to prevent air stratification and the formation of air pockets.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>1.6.3 Means shall be provided to indicate on the navigating bridge any loss or reduction of the required ventilating capacity.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>1.6.4 Arrangements shall be provided to permit a rapid shut-down and effective closure of the ventilation system in case of fire, taking into account the weather and sea conditions.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>1.6.5 Ventilation ducts, including dampers, shall be made of steel and their arrangement shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Additional provisions applicable only to special category spaces above the bulkhead deck</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 Scuppers</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>In view of the serious loss of stability which could arise due to large quantities of water accumulating on the deck or decks consequent on the operation of the fixed pressure water-spraying system, scuppers shall be fitted so as to ensure that such water is rapidly discharged directly overboard.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 Precautions against ignition of flammable vapours</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>2.2.1 On any deck or platform, if fitted, on which vehicles are carried and on which explosive vapours might be expected to accumulate, except platforms with openings of sufficient size permitting penetration of petrol gases downwards, equipment which may constitute a source of ignition of flammable vapours and, in particular, electrical equipment and wiring, shall be installed at least 450mmabove the deck or platform. Electrical equipment installed at more than 450mmabove the deck or platform shall be of a type so enclosed and protected as to prevent the escape of sparks. However, if the Administration is satisfied that the installation of electrical equipment and wiring at less than 450mmabove the deck or platform is necessary for the safe operation of the ship, such electrical equipment and wiring may be installed provided that it is of a type approved for use in an explosive petrol and air mixture.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>2.2.2 Electrical equipment and wiring if installed in an exhaust ventilation duct, shall be of a type approved for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures and the outlet from any exhaust duct shall be sited in a safe position, having regard to other possible sources of ignition.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Additional provisions applicable only to special category spaces below the bulkhead deck</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 Bilge pumping and drainage</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>In view of the serious loss of stability which could arise due to large quantities of water accumulating on the deck or tank top consequent on the operation of the fixed pressure water-spraying system, the Administration may require pumping and drainage facilities to be provided additional to the requirements of Regulation II-1/21.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 Precautions against ignition of flammable vapours</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>3.2.1 Electrical equipment and wiring, if fitted, shall be of a type suitable for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures. Other equipment which may constitute a source of ignition of flammable vapours shall not be permitted.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>3.2.2 Electrical equipment and wiring, if installed in an exhaust ventilation duct, shall be of a type approved for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures and the outlet from any exhaust duct shall be sited in a safe position, having regard to other possible sources of ignition.</H6></BODY></HTML>
