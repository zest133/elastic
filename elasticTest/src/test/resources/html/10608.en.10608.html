<H3 class=regulation align=center>Portable Radio Apparatus for Survival Craft</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The apparatus required by regulation 13 of Chapter III shall include a transmitter, a receiver, an antenna and a source of energy. It shall be so designed that it can be used in an emergency by an unskilled person.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The apparatus shall be readily portable, watertight, capable of floating in sea water and capable of being dropped into the sea without damage. New equipment shall be as light-weight and compact as practicable and shall preferably be capable of use in both lifeboats and liferafts.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The transmitter shall be capable of transmitting on the radiotelegraph distress frequency using a class of emission assigned by the Radio Regulations for that frequency, and, in the bands between 4,000 kHz and 27,500 kHz, of transmitting on the radiotelegraph frequency, and of using a class of emission assigned by the Radio Regulations for survival craft. However, the Administration may permit the transmitter to be capable of transmitting on the radiotelephone distress frequency, and of using a class of emission assigned by the Radio Regulations for that frequency, as an alternative or in addition to transmission on the radiotelegraph frequency assigned by the Radio Regulations for survival craft in the bands between 4,000 kHz and 27,500 kHz.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The transmitter shall, if modulated emission is prescribed by the Radio Regulations, have a depth of modulation of not less than 70 per cent and in the case of radiotelegraph emission have a note frequency between 450 and 1,350 Hz.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) In addition to a key for manual transmissions, the transmitter shall be fitted with an automatic keying device for the transmission of the radiotelegraph alarm and distress signals. If the transmitter is capable of transmitting on the radiotelephone distress frequency, it shall be fitted with an automatic device, complying with the requirements of paragraph (e) of regulation 16 of this Chapter, for transmitting the radiotelephone alarm signal.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) The receiver shall be capable of receiving the radiotelegraph distress frequency and the classes of emission assigned by the Radio Regulations for that frequency. If the transmitter is capable of transmitting on the radiotelephone distress frequency the receiver shall also be capable of receiving that frequency and a class of emission assigned by the Radio Regulations for that frequency.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) The antenna shall be either self-supporting or capable of being supported by the mast of a lifeboat at the maximum practicable height. In addition it is desirable that an antenna supported by a kite or balloon shall be provided if practicable.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) The transmitter shall supply an adequate radio frequency power* to the antenna required by paragraph (a) of this regulation and shall preferably derive its supply from a hand generator. If operated from a battery, the battery shall comply with conditions laid down by the Administration to ensure that it is of a durable type and is of adequate capacity.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* It may be assumed that the purpose of this regulation will be satisfied by the following performance: At least 10 watts input to the anode of the final stage or a radio-frequency output of at least 2.0 watts (A2 emission) at 500 kHz into an artificial antenna having an effective resistance of 15 ohms and 100 x 10- 12 farads capacitance in series. The depth of modulation shall be at least 70 per cent.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(i) At sea a radio officer or a radiotelephone operator, as appropriate, shall at weekly intervals test the transmitter, using a suitable artificial antenna and shall bring the battery up to full charge if it is of a type which requires charging.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(j) For the purpose of this Regulation, new equipment means equipment supplied to a ship after the date of entry into force of the present Convention.</H4></BODY></HTML>
