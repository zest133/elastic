<H3 class=regulation align=center>Duration of Certificates</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Certificates other than Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificates, Cargo Ship Safety Equipment Certificates and Exemption Certificates shall be issued for a period of not more than 12 months. Cargo Ship Safety Equipment Certificates shall be issued for a period of not more than 24 months. Exemption Certificates shall not be valid for longer than the period of the certificates to which they refer.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) If a survey takes place within two months before the end of the period for which a Cargo Ship Safety Radiotelegraphy Certificate or a Cargo Ship Safety Radiotelephony Certificate issued in respect of cargo ships of 300 tons gross tonnage and upwards, but less than 500 tons gross tonnage, was originally issued, that certificate may be withdrawn, and a new certificate may be issued which shall expire 12 months after the end of the said period.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) If a ship at the time when its certificate expires is not in a port of the country in which it is registered, the certificate may be extended by the Administration, but such extension shall be granted only for the purpose of allowing the ship to complete its voyage to the country in which it is registered or in which it is to be surveyed, and then only in cases where it appears proper and reasonable so to do.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) No certificate shall be thus extended for a longer period than five months, and a ship to which such extension is granted shall not, on its arrival in the country in which it is registered or the port in which it is to be surveyed, be entitled by virtue of such extension to leave that port or country without having obtained a new certificate.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) A certificate which has not been extended under the foregoing provisions of this Regulation may be extended by the Administration for a period of grace of up to one month from the date of expiry stated on it.</H4></BODY></HTML>
