<H3 class=regulation align=center>Cargo Tank Protection</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) For new tankers of 20,000 metric tons deadweight and upwards, the protection of the cargo tank decks area and cargo tanks shall be achieved by a fixed deck froth system and a fixed inert gas system in accordance with the requirements of Regulations 61 and 62 of Chapter II-2 of the Convention except that in lieu of the above installations the Administration, after having given consideration to the ship's arrangement and equipment, may accept other combinations of fixed installations if they afford protection equivalent to the above, in accordance with Regulation 5 of Chapter I of the Convention.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) To be considered equivalent, the system proposed in lieu of the deck froth system shall:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) be capable of extinguishing spill fires and also preclude ignition of spilled oil not yet ignited; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) be capable of combating fires in ruptured tanks.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) To be considered equivalent, the system proposed in lieu of the fixed inert gas system shall:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) be capable of preventing dangerous accumulations of explosive mixtures in intact cargo tanks during normal service throughout the ballast voyage and necessary in-tank operations; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) be so designed as to minimize the risk of ignition from the generation of static electricity by the system itself.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) Any existing tanker of 20,000 metric tons deadweight and upwards engaged in the trade of carrying crude oil shall be fitted with an inert gas system, complying with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this Regulation, not later than a date:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) for a tanker of 70,000 metric tons deadweight and upwards, two years after the date of entry into force of the present Protocol ; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) for a tanker of less than 70,000 metric tons deadweight and upwards, four years after the date of entry into force of the present Protocol, except that for tankers less than 40,000 tons deadweight not fitted with tank washing machines having an individual throughput of greater than 60 cubic metres per hour, the Administration may exempt existing tankers from the requirements of this paragraph, if it would be unreasonable and impracticable to apply these requirements, taking into account the ship's design characteristics.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) Any existing tanker of 40,000 metric tons deadweight and upwards engaged in the trade of carrying oil other than crude oil and any such tanker of 20,000 metric tons deadweight and upwards engaged in the trade of carrying oil other than crude oil fitted with tank washing machines having an individual throughput of greater than 60 cubic metres per hour shall be fitted with an inert gas system, complying with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this Regulation, not later than a date:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) for a tanker of 70,000 metric tons deadweight and upwards, two years after the date of entry into force of the present Protocol ; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) for a tanker of less than 70,000 metric tons deadweight four years after the date of entry into force of the present Protocol.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) Any tanker operating with a cargo tank cleaning procedure using crude oil washing shall be fitted with an inert gas system complying with the requirements of Regulation 62 of Chapter II-2 of the Convention and with fixed tank washing machines.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) All tankers fitted with a fixed inert gas system shall be provided with a closed ullage system.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) Any new tanker of 2,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards not covered by paragraph (a) of this Regulation shall be provided with a froth system, capable of discharging froth internally or externally, to the tanks. The details of such installation shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4></BODY></HTML>
