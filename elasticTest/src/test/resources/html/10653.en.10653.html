<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The master of a ship at sea, on receiving a signal from any source that a ship or aircraft or survival craft thereof is in distress, is bound to proceed with all speed to the assistance of the persons in distress informing them if possible that he is doing so. If he is unable or, in the special circumstances of the case, considers it unreasonable or unnecessary to proceed to their assistance, he must enter in the logbook the reason for failing to proceed to the assistance of the persons in distress.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The master of a ship in distress, after consultation, so far as may be possible, with the masters of the ships which answer his call for assistance, has the right to requisition such one or more of those ships as he considers best able to render assistance, and it shall be the duty of the master or masters of the ship or ships requisitioned to comply with the requisition by continuing to proceed with all speed to the assistance of persons in distress.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The master of a ship shall be released from the obligation imposed by paragraph</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(a) of this regulation when he learns that one or more ships other than his own have been requisitioned and are complying with the requisition.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The master of a ship shall be released from the obligation imposed by paragraph</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(a) of this Regulation, and, if his ship has been requisitioned, from the obligation imposed by paragraph (b) of this Regulation, if he is informed by the persons in distress or by the master of another ship which has reached such persons that assistance is no longer necessary.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) The provisions of this regulation do not prejudice the Convention for the unification of certain rules of Law relating to Assistance and Salvage at Sea, signed at Brussels on 23 September 1910, particularly the obligation to render assistance imposed by Article 11 of that Convention.</H4>
