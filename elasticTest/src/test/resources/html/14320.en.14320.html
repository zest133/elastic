<h3 class="regulation" align="center">Openings in watertight bulkheads in passenger ships</h3>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">(This regulation applies to ships constructed on or after 1 February 1992)</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">1 The number of openings in watertight bulkheads shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship;satisfactory means shall be provided for closing these openings.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">2.1 Where pipes, scuppers, electric cables, etc., are carried through watertight subdivision bulkheads, arrangements shall be made to ensure the watertight integrity of the bulkheads.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">2.2 Valves not forming part of a piping system shall not be permitted in watertight subdivision bulkheads.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">2.3 Lead or other heat sensitive materials shall not be used in systems which penetrate watertight subdivision bulkheads, where deterioration of such systems in the event of fire would impair the watertight integrity of the bulkheads.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">3.1 No doors, manholes, or access openings are permitted.</h4>
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.1 in the collision bulkhead below the margin line;</h5>
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.2 in watertight transverse bulkheads dividing a cargo space from an adjoining cargo space or from a permanent or reserve bunker, except as provided in paragraph 10.1 and in regulation 16.</h5>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">3.2 Except as provided in paragraph 3.3 the collision bulkhead may be pierced below the margin line by not more than one pipe for dealing with fluid in the forepeak tank, provided that the pipe is fitted with a scrw down valve capable of being operated from above the bulkhead deck, the valve chest being secured inside the forepeak to the bulkhead deck. The Administration may, however, authorize the fitting of this valve on the after side of the collision bulkhead provided that the valve is readily accessible under all service conditions and the space in which it is located is not a cargo space.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">3.3 If the forepeak is divided to hold two different kinds of liquids the Administration may allow the collision bulkhead to be pierced below the margin line by two pipes, each of which is fitted as required by paragraph 3.2 provided the Administration is satisfied that there is no practical alternative to the fitting of such a second pipe and that, having regard to the additional subdivision provided in the forepeak, the safety of the ship is maintained.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">4.1 Watertight doors fitted in bulkheads between permanent and reserve bunkers shall always be accessible, except as provided in paragraph 9.4 for between-deck bunker doors.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">4.2 Satisfactory arrangements shall be made by means of screens or otherwise to prevent the coal from interfering with the closing of watertight bunker doors.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">5 Subject to paragraph 11, not more than one door, apart from the doors to bunkers and shaft tunnels, may be fitted in each main transverse bulkhead within spaces containing the main and auxiliary propulsion machinery including boilers serving the needs of propulsion and all permanent bunkers. Where two or more shafts are fitted, the tunnels shall be connected by an intercommunicating passage. There shall be only one door between the machinery space and the tunnel spaces where two shafts are fitted and only two doors where there are more than two shafts. All these doors shall be of the sliding type and shall be so located as to have their sills as high as practicable. The hand gear for operating these doors from above the bulkhead deck shall be situated outside the spaces containing the machinery.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">6.1 Watertight doors, except as provided in paragraph 10.1 or regulation 16, shall be power-operated sliding doors complying with the requirements of paragraph 7 capable of being closed simultaneously from the central operating console at the navigating bridge in not more than 60s with the ship in the upright position.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">6.2 The means of operation whether by power or by hand of any power-operated sliding watertight door shall be capable of closing the door with the ship listed to 15°either way. Consideration shall also be given to the forces which may act on either side of the door as may be experienced when water is flowing through the opening applying a static head equivalent to a water height of at least 1m above the sill on the centreline of the door.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">6.3 Watertight door controls, including hydraulic piping and electric cables, shall be kept as close as practicable to the bulkhead in which the doors are fitted, in order to minimize the likelihood of them being involved in any damage which the ship may sustain. The positioning of watertight doors and their controls shall be such that if the ship sustains damage within one fifth of the breadth of the ship, as defined in regulation 2, such distance being measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision load line, the operation of the watertight doors clear of the damaged portion of the ship is not impaired.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">6.4 All power-operated sliding watertight doors shall be provided with means of indication which will show at all remote operating positions whether doors are open or closed. Remote operating positions shall only be at the navigating bridge as required by paragraph 7.1.5 and at the location where hand operation above the bulkhead deck is required by paragraph 7.1.4.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">6.5 In ships constructed before 1 February 1992, doors which do not comply with paragraphs 6.1 to 6.4 shall be closed before the voyage commences, and shall be kept closed during navigation; the time of opening such doors in port and of closing them before the ship leaves port shall be entered into the log-book.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">7.1 Each power-operated sliding watertight door:</h4>
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.1 shall have a vertical or horizontal motion.</h5>
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.2 shall, subject to paragraph 11, be normally limited to a maximum clear opening width of 1.2 m. The Administration may permit larger doors only to the extent considered necessary for the effective operation of the ship provided that other safety measures, including the following, are taken into consideration:</h5>
<h6 class="body2" align="justify">.2.1 special consideration shall be given to the strength of the door and its closing appliances in order to prevent leakages;</h6>
<h6 class="body2" align="justify">.2.2 the door shall be located outside the damage zone B 5 ;</h6>
<h6 class="body2" align="justify">.2.3 the door shall be kept closed when the ship is at sea, except for limited periods when absolutely necessary as determined by the Administration;</h6>
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.3 shall be fitted with the necessary equipment to open and close the door using electric power, hydraulic power, or any other form of power that is acceptable to the Administration.</h5>
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.4 shall be provided with an individual hand-operated mechanism. It shall be possible to open and close the door by hand at the door itself from either side, and in addition, close the door from an accessible position above the bulkhead deck with an all round crank motion or some other movement providing the same degree of safety acceptable to their Administration. Direction of rotation of other movement is to be clearly indicated at all operating positions, The time necessary for the complete closure of the door, when operating by hand gear, shall not exceed 90s with the ship in the upright position;</h5>
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.5 shall be provided with controls for opening and closing the door by power from both sides of the door and also for closing the door by power from the central operating console at the navigating bridge;</h5>
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.6 shall be provided an audible alarm, distinct from any other alarm in the area, which will sound whenever the door is closed remotely by power and which shall sound for at least 5s but no more than 10s before the door begins to move and shall continue sounding until the door is completely closed. In the case of remote hand operation it is sufficient for the audible alarm to sound only when the door is moving. Additionally, in passenger areas and areas of high ambient noise the Administration may require the audible alarm to be supplemented by an intermittent visual signal at the door ; and</h5><br />
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.7 shall have an approximately uniform rate of closure under power. The closure time, from the time the door begins to move to the time it reaches the completely closed position, shall in no case be less than 20s or more than 40s with the ship in the upright position.</h5>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">7.2 The electrical power required for power-operated sliding watertight doors shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck. The associated control, indication and alarm circuits shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck and be capable of being automatically supplied by the transitional source of emergency electrical power required by regulation 42.3.1.3 in the event of failure of either the main or emergency source of electrical power.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">7.3 Power-operated sliding watertight doors shall have either:</h4>
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.1 a centralized hydraulic system with two independent power sources each consisting of a motor and pump capable of simultaneously closing all doors. In addition, there shall be for the whole installation hydraulic accumulators of sufficient capacity to operate all the doors at least three times, i.e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15°. This operating cycle shall be capable of being carried out when the accumulator is at the pump cut-in pressure. The fluid used shall be chosen considering the temperatures liable to be encountered by the installation during its service. The power operating system shall be designed to minimize the possibility of having a single failure in the hydraulic piping adversely affect the operation of more than one door. The hydraulic system shall be provided with a low-level alarm for hydraulic fluid reservoirs serving the power-operated system and a low gas pressure alarm or other effective means of monitoring loss of stored energy in hydraulic accumulators. These alarms are to be audible and visual and shall be situated on the central operating console at the navigating bridge ; or</h5><br />
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.2 an independent hydraulic system for each door with each power source consisting of a motor and pump capable of opening and closing the door. In addition, there shall be a hydraulic accumulator of sufficient capacity to operate the door at least three times, i.e closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15°. This operating cycle shall be capable of being carried out when the accumulator is at the pump cut-in pressure. The fluid used shall be chosen considering the temperatures liable to be encountered by the installation during its service. A low gas pressure group alarm or other effective means of monitoring loss of stored energy in hydraulic accumulators shall be provided at the central operating console on the navigating bridge. Loss of stored energy indication at each local operating position shall also be provided ; or</h5><br />
<h5 class="body1" align="justify">.3 an independent electrical system and motor for each door with each power source consisting of a motor capable of opening and closing the door. The power source shall be capable of being automatically supplied by the transitional source of emergency electrical power as required by regulation 42.4.2-in the event of failure of either the main or emergency source of electrical power and with sufficient capacity to operate the door at least three times, i.e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15°.</h5><br />
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">For the systems specified in 7.3.1, 7.3.2 and 7.3.3, provision should be made as follows:</h4><br />
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">Power systems for power-operated watertight sliding doors shall be separated from any other power system. A single failure in the electric or hydraulic power-operated systems excluding the hydraulic actuator shall not prevent the hand operation of any door.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">7.4 Control handles shall be provided at each side of the bulkhead at a minimum height of 1.6m above the floor and shall be so arranged as to enable persons passing through the doorway to hold both handles in the open position without being able to set the power closing mechanism in operation accidently. The direction of movement of the handles in opening and closing the door shall be in the direction of door movement and shall be clearly indicated.</h4><br />
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">7.5 As far as practicable, electrical equipment and components for watertight doors shall be situated above the bulkhead deck and outside hazardous areas and spaces.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">7.6 The enclosures of electrical components necessarily situated below the bulkhead deck shall provides suitable protection against the ingress of water.*</h4>
<h6 class="footnote" align="justify">* Refer to the following IEC publication 529,1976:</h6>
<h6 class="footnote" align="justify">.1 electrical motors, associated circuits and control components : protected to IPX7 standard:</h6>
<h6 class="footnote" align="justify">.2 Door position indicators and associated circuit components : protected to IPX8 standard: and</h6>
<h6 class="footnote" align="justify">.3 Door movement warning signals :protected to IPX6 standard. Other arrangements for the enclosures of electrical components may be fitted provided the Administration is satisfied that an equivalent protection is achieved. The water pressure testing of the enclosures protected to IPX8 shall be based on the pressure that may occur at the location of the component during flooding for a period of 36h.</h6><br />
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">7.7 Electric power, control, indication and alarm circuits shall be protected against fault in such a way that a failure in one door circuit will not cause a failure in any other door circuit. Short circuits or other faults in the alarm or indicator circuits of a door shall not result in a loss of power operation of that door. Arrangements shall be such that leakage of water into the electrical equipment located below the bulkhead deck will not cause the door to open.</h4><br />
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">7.8 A single electrical failure in the power operating or control system of a power-operated sliding watertight door shall not result in a closed door opening. Availability of the power supply should be continuously monitored at a point in the electrical circuit as near as practicable to each of the motors required by paragraph 7.3. Loss of any such power supply should activate an audible and visual alarm at the central operating console at the navigating bridge.</h4><br />
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">8.1 The central operating console at the navigating bridge shall have a " master mode" switch with two modes of control : a "local control" mode which shall allow any door to be locally opened and locally closed after use without automatic closure, and a "doors closed" mode which shall automatically close any door that is open. The "doors closed" mode shall permit doors to be opened locally and shall automatically reclose the doors upon release of the local control mechanism. The "master mode" switch shall normally be in the "local control" mode. The "doors closed" mode shall only be used in an emergency or for testing purposes. Special consideration shall be given to the reliability of the "master mode" switch.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">8.2 The central operating console at the navigating bridge shall be provided with a diagram showing the location of each door, with visual indicators to show whether each door is open or closed. A red light shall indicate a door is fully open and a green light shall indicate a door is fully closed. When the door is closed remotely the red light shall indicate the intermediate position by flashing. The indicating circuit shall be independent of the control circuit for each door.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">8.3 It shall not be possible to remotely open any door from the central operating console.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">9.1 All watertight doors shall be kept closed during navigation except that they may be opened during navigation as specified in paragraphs 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4. Watertight doors of width of more than 1.2m permitted by paragraph 11 may only be opened in the circumstances detailed in that paragraph. Any door which is opened in accordance with this paragraph shall be ready to be immediately closed.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">9.2 A watertight door may be opened during navigation to permit the passage of passengers or crew, or when work in the immediate vicinity of the door necessitates it being opened. The door must be immediately closed when transit through the door is complete or when the task which necessitated it being open is finished.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">9.3 Certain watertight doors may be permitted to remain open during navigation only if considered absolutely necessary ; that is, being open is determined essential to the safe and effective operation of the ship's machinery or to permit passengers normally unrestricted access throughout the passenger area. Such determination shall be made by the Administration only after careful consideration of the impact on ship operations and survivability. A watertight door permitted to remain thus open shall be clearly indicated in the ship's stability information and shall always be ready to immediately closed.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">9.4 Sliding watertight doors fitted between bunkers in the between-decks below the bulkhead deck may sometimes be open at sea for the purpose of trimming coal. The opening and closing of these doors shall be recorded in such log-book as may be prescribed by the Administration</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">10.1 If the Administration is satisfied that such doors are essential, watertight doors of satisfactory construction may be fitted in watertight bulkheads dividing cargo between deck spaces. Such doors may be hinged, rolling or sliding doors but shall not be remotely controlled. They shall be fitted at the highest level and as far from the shell plating as practicable, but in no case shall the outboard vertical edges be situated at a distance from the shell plating which is less than one fifth of the breadth of the ship, as defined in regulation 2, such distance being measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision load line.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">10.2 Such doors shall be closed before the voyage commences and shall be kept closed during navigation ; the time of opening such doors in port and of closing them before the ship leaves port shall be entered in the log-book. Should any of the doors be accessible during the voyage, they shall be fitted with a device which prevents unauthorized opening, When it is proposed to fit such doors, the number and arrangements shall receive the special consideration of the Administration.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">11 Portable plates on bulkheads shall not be permitted except in machinery spaces. Such plates shall always be in place before the ship leaves port, and shall not be removed during navigation except in case of urgent necessity at the discretion of the master. The times of removal and replacement of any such portable plates shall be recorded in the log-book, and the necessary precautions shall be taken in replacing them to ensure that the joints are watertight. The Administration may permit not more than one power-operated sliding watertight door in each main transverse bulkhead larger than those specified in paragraph 7.1.2 to be substituted for these portable plates, provided these doors are closed before the ship leaves port and remain closed during navigation except in case of urgent necessity at the discretion of the master. These doors need not meet the requirements of paragraph 7.1.4 regarding complete closure by hand-operated gear in 90s. The time of opening and closing these doors, whether the ship is at sea or in port, shall be recorded in the log-book.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">12.1 Where trunkways or tunnels for access from crew accommodation to the stokehold, for piping, or for any other purpose are carried through main transverse watertight bulkheads, they shall be watertight and in accordance with the requirements of regulation 19. The access to at least one end of each such tunnel or trunkway, if used as a passage at sea, shall be through a trunk extending watertight to a height sufficient to permit access above the the margin line. The access to the other end of the trunkway or tunnel may be through a watertight door of the type required by its location in the ship. Such trunkways or tunnels shall not extend through the first subdivision bulkhead abaft the collision bulkhead.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">12.2 Where it is proposed to fit tunnels piercing main transverse watertight bulkheads, these shall receive the special consideration of the Administration.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">12.3 Where trunkways in connection with refrigerated cargo and ventilation or forced draught trunks are carried through more than one watertight bulkhead, the means of closure at such openings shall be operated by power and be capable of being closed form a central position situated above the bulkhead deck.</h4></body>
