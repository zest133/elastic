    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">(Paragraph 2 of this regulation applies to ships constructed on or after 1 February 1992).</H4>
    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">1 Cargo tank venting</H4>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.1 The venting systems of cargo tanks are to be entirely distinct from the air pipes of the other compartments of the ship. The arrangements and position of openings in the cargo tank deck from which emission of flammable vapours can occur shall be such as to minimize the possibility of flammable vapours being admitted to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition, or collecting in the vicinity of deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard. In accordance with this general principle the criteria in paragraphs 1.2 to 1.10 will apply.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.2 The venting arrangements shall be so designed and operated as to ensure that neither pressure nor vacuum in cargo tanks shall exceed design parameters and be such as to provide for:</H5>
    <H6 CLASS="body2" ALIGN="justify">.1 the flow of the small volumes of vapour, air or inert gas mixtures caused by thermal variations in a cargo tank in all cases through pressure/vacuum valves; and</H6>
    <H6 CLASS="body2" ALIGN="justify">.2 the passage of large volumes of vapour, air or inert gas mixtures during cargo loading and ballasting, or during discharging.</H6>
    <H6 CLASS="body2" ALIGN="justify">.3 a secondary means of allowing full flow relief of vapour, air or inert gas mixtures to prevent over-pressure or under-pressure in the event of failure of the arrangements in 1.2.2. Alternatively, pressure sensors may be fitted in each tank protected by the arrangement required in 1.2.2, with a monitoring system in the ship's cargo control room or the position from which cargo operations are normally carried out. Such monitoring equipment shall also provide an alarm facility which is activated by detection of over-pressure or under-pressure conditions within a tank.</H6>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.3.1 The venting arrangements in each cargo tank may be independent or combined with other cargo tanks and may be incorporated into the inert gas piping.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.3.2 Where the arrangements are combined with other cargo tanks, either stop valves or other acceptable means shall be provided to isolate each cargo tank. Where stop valves are fitted, they shall be provided with locking arrangements which shall be under the control of the responsible ship's officer. There shall be a clear visual indication of the operational status of the valves or other acceptable means. Where tanks have been isolated, it shall be ensured that relevant isolating valves are opened before cargo loading or ballasting or discharging of those tanks is commenced. Any isolation must continue to permit the flow caused by thermal variations in a cargo tank in accordance with paragraph 1.2.1.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.3.3 If cargo loading and ballasting or discharging of a cargo tank or cargo tank group is intended, which is isolated from a common venting system, that cargo tank or cargo tank group shall be fitted with a means for over-pressure or under-pressure protection as required in paragraph 1.2.3.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.4 The venting arrangements shall be connected to the top of each cargo tank and shall be self-draining to the cargo tanks under all normal conditions of trim and list of the ship. Where it may not be possible to provide self-draining lines, permanent arrangements shall be provided to drain the vent lines to a cargo tank.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.5 The venting system shall be provided with devices to prevent the passage of flame into the cargo tanks. The design, testing and locating of these devices shall comply with the requirements established by the Administration which shall contain at least the standards adopted by the Organization.*</H5>
    <H6 CLASS="footnote" ALIGN="justify">* Refer to MSC/Circ.677 on Revised standards for the design, testing and locating of devices to prevent the passage of flame into cargo tanks in oil tankers, and to MSC/Circ. 450/Rev. 1:Revised factors to be taken into consideration when designing cargo tank venting and gas-freeing arrangements.</H6>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.6 Provision shall be made to guard against liquid rising in the venting system to a height which would exceed the design head of cargo tanks. This shall be accomplished by high level alarms or overflow control systems or other equivalent means, together with gauging devices and cargo tank filling procedures.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.7 Openings for pressure release required by paragraph 1.2.1 shall:</H5>
    <H6 CLASS="body2" ALIGN="justify">.1 have as great a height as is practicable above the cargo tank deck to obtain maximum dispersal of flammable vapours but in no case less than 2m above the cargo tank deck:</H6>
    <H6 CLASS="body2" ALIGN="justify">.2 be arranged at the furthest distance practicable but not less than 5m from the nearest air intakes and openings to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition and from deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard.</H6>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.8 Pressure/vacuum valves required by paragraph 1.2.1 may be provided with a bypass arrangement when they are located in a vent main or masthead riser. Where such an arrangement is provided there shall be suitable indicators to show whether the bypass is open or closed.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.9 Vent outlets for cargo loading, discharging and ballasting required by paragraph 1.2.2 shall:</H5>
    <H6 CLASS="body2" ALIGN="justify">.1.1 permit the free flow of vapour mixtures;or</H6>

    <H6 CLASS="body2" ALIGN="justify">.2 be so arranged that the vapour mixture is discharged vertically upwards;</H6>
    <H6 CLASS="body2" ALIGN="justify">.3 where the method is by free flow of vapour mixtures, be such that the outlet shall be not less than 6m above the cargo tank deck or fore and aft gangway if situated within 4m of the gangway and located not less than 10m measured horizontally from the nearest air intakes and openings to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition and from deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard;</H6>
    <H6 CLASS="body2" ALIGN="justify">.4 where the method is by high velocity discharge, be located at a height not less than 2m above the cargo tank deck and not less than 10m measured horizontally from the nearest air intakes and openings to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition and from deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard. These outlets shall be provided with high velocity devices of an approved type;</H6>
    <H6 CLASS="body2" ALIGN="justify">.5 be designed on the basis of the maximum designed loading rate multiplied by a factor of at least 1.25 to take account of gas evolution, in order to prevent the pressure in any cargo tank from exceeding the design pressure. The master shall be provided with information regarding the maximum permissible loading rate for each cargo tank and in the case of combined venting systems, for each group of cargo tanks.</H6>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.10 In combination carriers, the arrangement to isolate slop tanks containing oil or oil residues from other cargo tanks shall consist of blank flanges which will remain in position at all times when cargoes other than liquid cargoes referred to in Regulation 55.1 are carried.</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">1.11 Ships constructed before 1 July 1998 shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs 1.2.3 and 1.3.3 by the date of the first scheduled dry-docking after 1 July 1998, but nor later than 1 July 2001.</H5>
