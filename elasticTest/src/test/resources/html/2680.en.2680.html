<H3 class=regulation style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">(Paragraphs 10 and 11 of this regulation apply to ships constructed on or after 1 January 2007) </H3>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">1.1 Exposed metal parts of electrical machines or equipment which are not intended to be live but which are liable under fault conditions to become live shall be earthed unless the machines or equipments are:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 supplied at a voltage not exceeding 50V direct current or 50V, root mean square between conductors ; autotransformers shall not be used for the purpose of achieving this voltage;or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 supplied at a voltage not exceeding 250V by safety isolating transformers supplying only one consuming device;or</H5>
