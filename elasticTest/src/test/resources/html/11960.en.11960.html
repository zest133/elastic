<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 10</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Peak and machinery space bulkheads, shaft tunnels, etc. in passenger ships</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 A forepeak or collision bulkhead shall be fitted which shall be watertight up to the bulkhead deck. This bulkhead shall be located at a distance from the forward perpendicular of not less than 5 percent of the length of the ship and not more than 3 m plus 5 percent of the length of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Where any part of the ship below the water-line extends forward of the forward perpendicular, e.g. a bulbous bow, the distances stipulated in paragraph 1 shall be measured from a point either:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 at the mid-length of such extension; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 at a distance 1.5 percent of the length of the ship forward of the forward perpendicular; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 at a distance 3 m forward of the forward perpendicular; whichever gives the smallest measurement.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Where a long forward superstructure is fitted, the forepeak or collision bulkhead shall be extended weathertight to the deck next above the bulkhead deck. The extension need not be fitted directly above the bulkhead below provided it is located within the limits specified in paragraph 1 or 2 with the exemption permitted by paragraph 4 and the part of the deck which forms the step is made effectively weathertight.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Where bow doors are fitted and a sloping loading ramp forms part of the extension of the collision bulkhead above the bulkhead deck the part of the ramp which is more than 2.3 m above the bulkhead deck may extend forward of the limit specified in paragraphs 1 and 2. The ramp shall be weathertight over its complete length.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 An afterpeak bulkhead, and bulkheads dividing the machinery space, as defined in Regulation 2, from the cargo and passenger spaces forward and aft, shall also be fitted and made watertight up to the bulkhead deck. The afterpeak bulkhead may, however, be stepped below the bulkhead deck, provided the degree of safety of the ship as regards subdivision is not thereby diminished.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 In all cases stern tubes shall be enclosed in watertight spaces of moderate volume. The stern gland shall be situated in a watertight shaft tunnel or other watertight space separate from the stern tube compartment and of such volume that, if flooded by leakage through the stern gland, the margin line will not be submerged.</H4></BODY></HTML>
