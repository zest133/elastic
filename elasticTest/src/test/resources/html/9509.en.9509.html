<H3 class=regulation align=center>Control</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Every ship holding a certificate issued under Regulation 12 or Regulation 13 of this Chapter is subject in the ports of the other Contracting Governments to control by officers duly authorized by such Governments in so far as this control is directed towards verifying that there is on board a valid certificate. Such certificate shall be accepted unless there are clear grounds for believing that the condition of the ship or of its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of that certificate. In that case, the officer carrying out the control shall take such steps as will ensure that the ship shall not sail until it can proceed to sea without danger to the passengers or the crew. In the event of this control giving rise to intervention of any kind, the officer carrying out the control shall inform the Consul of the country in which the ship is registered in writing forthwith of all the circumstances in which intervention was deemed to be necessary, and the facts shall be reported to the Organization.</H4></BODY></HTML>
