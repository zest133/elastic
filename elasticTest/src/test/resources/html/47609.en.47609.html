<H3 class=regulation align=center><U>Prohibition of the blending of bulk liquid cargoes and production processes during sea voyages</U></H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The physical blending of bulk liquid cargoes during sea voyages is prohibited. Physical blending refers to the process whereby the ship's cargo pumps and pipelines are used to internally circulate two or more different cargoes with the intent to achieve a cargo with a new product designation. This prohibition does not preclude the master from undertaking cargo transfers for the safety of the ship or protection of the marine environment.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The prohibition in paragraph 1 does not apply to the blending of products for use in the search and exploitation of seabed mineral resources on board ships used to facilitate such operations.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Any production process on board a ship during sea voyages is prohibited. Production processes refer to any deliberate operation whereby a chemical reaction between a ship's cargo and any other substance or cargo takes place.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 The prohibition in paragraph 3 does not apply to the production processes of cargoes for use in the search and exploitation of seabed mineral resources on board ships used to facilitate such operations.*</H4>
