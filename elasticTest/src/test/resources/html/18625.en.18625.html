<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.1.1</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>2.2.1.1.1 In ships carrying more than 36 passengers, the hull, superstructure and deckhouses shall be subdivided into main vertical zones by "A-60" class divisions. Steps and recesses shall be kept to a minimum, but where they are necessary they shall also be "A-60" class divisions. Where a category (5), (9) or (10) space defined in paragraph 2.2.3.2.2 is on one side or where fuel oil tanks are on both sides of the division the standard may be reduced to "A-0". </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>2.2.1.1.2 In ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, the hull, superstructure and deckhouses in way of accommodation and service spaces shall be subdivided into main vertical zones by "A" class divisions. These divisions shall have insulation values in accordance with tables in paragraph 2.2.4. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.1.2 As far as practicable, the bulkheads forming the boundaries of the main vertical zones above the bulkhead deck shall be in line with watertight subdivision bulkheads situated immediately below the bulkhead deck. The length and width of main vertical zones may be extended to a maximum of 48 m in order to bring the ends of main vertical zones to coincide with watertight subdivision bulkheads or in order to accommodate a large public space extending for the whole length of the main vertical zone provided that the total area of the main vertical zone is not greater than 1,600 mÂ² on any deck. The length or width of a main vertical zone is the maximum distance between the furthermost points of the bulkheads bounding it. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.1.3 Such bulkheads shall extend from deck to deck and to the shell or other boundaries. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.1.4 Where a main vertical zone is subdivided by horizontal "A" class divisions into horizontal zones for the purpose of providing an appropriate barrier between a zone with sprinklers and a zone without sprinklers, the divisions shall extend between adjacent main vertical zone bulkheads and to the shell or exterior boundaries of the ship and shall be insulated in accordance with the fire insulation and integrity values given in table 9.4. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.1.5</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>2.2.1.5.1 On ships designed for special purposes, such as automobile or railroad car ferries, where the provision of main vertical zone bulkheads would defeat the purpose for which the ship is intended, equivalent means for controlling and limiting a fire shall be substituted and specifically approved by the Administration. Service spaces and ship stores shall not be located on ro-ro decks unless protected in accordance with the applicable regulations. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>2.2.1.5.2 However, in a ship with special category spaces, such spaces shall comply with the applicable provisions of regulation 20 and where such compliance would be inconsistent with other requirements for passenger ships specified in this chapter, the requirements of regulation 20 shall prevail. </H6></BODY></HTML>
