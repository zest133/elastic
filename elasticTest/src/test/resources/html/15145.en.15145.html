<H3 class=regulation align=center>Loading, unloading and stowage of bulk cargoes*</H3>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7321&amp;localekey=en">A.862(20).</A></H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 For the purpose of this regulation, terminal representative means a person appointed by the terminal or other facility, where the ship is loading or unloading, who has responsibility for operations conducted by that terminal or facility with regard to the particular ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 To enable the master to prevent excessive stresses in the ship's structure, the ship shall be provided with a booklet, which shall be written in a language with which the ship's officers responsible for cargo operations are familiar. If this language is not English, the ship shall be provided with a booklet written also in the English language. The booklet shall, as a minimum, include:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 stability data, as required by regulation II-1/22;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 ballasting and deballasting rates and capacities;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 maximum allowable load per unit surface area of the tank top plating;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 maximum allowable load per hold;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 general loading and unloading instructions with regard to the strength of the ship's structure including any limitations on the most adverse operating conditions during loading, unloading, ballasting operations and the voyage;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 any special restrictions such as limitations on the most adverse operating conditions imposed by the Administration or organization recognized by it, if applicable;and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.7 where strength calculations are required, maximum permissible forces and moments on the ship's hull during loading, unloading and the voyage.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Before a solid bulk cargo is loaded or unloaded, the master and the terminal representative shall agree on plan** which shall ensure that the permissible forces and moments on the ship are not exceeded during loading or unloading, and shall include the sequence, quantity and rate of loading or unloading, taking into consideration the speed of loading or unloading, the number of pours and the deballasting or ballasting capability of the ship. the plan and any subsequent amendments thereto shall be lodged with the appropriate authority of the port State.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>** Refer to the Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7321&amp;localekey=en">A.862(20).</A></H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Bulk cargoes shall be loaded and trimmed reasonably level, as necessary, to the boundaries of the cargo space so as to minimize the risk of shifting and to ensure that adequate stability will be maintained throughout the voyage.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 When bulk cargoes are carried in 'tween-decks, the hatchways of such 'tween-decks shall be closed in those cases where the loading information indicates an unacceptable level of stress of the bottom structure if the hatchways are left open. The cargo shall be trimmed reasonably level and shall either extend from side to or be secured by additional longitudinal divisions of sufficient strength. The safe load-carrying capacity of the 'tween-decks shall be observed to ensure that the deck-structure is not overloaded.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 The master and terminal representative shall ensure that loading and unloading operations are conducted in accordance with the agreed plan.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 If during loading or unloading any of the limits of the ship referred to in paragraph 2 are exceeded or are likely to become so if the loading or unloading continues, the master has the right to suspend operation and the obligation to notify accordingly the appropriate authority of the port State with which the plan has been lodged. The master and the terminal representative shall ensure that corrective action is taken. when unloading cargo, the master and terminal representative shall ensure that the unloading method does not damage the ship's structure.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 The master shall ensure that ship's personnel continuously monitor cargo operations. Where possible, the ship's draught shall be checked regularly during loading or unloading to confirm the tonnage figures supplied. Each draught and tonnage observation shall be recorded in a cargo log-book. If significant deviations from the agreed plan are detected, cargo or ballast operations or both shall be adjusted to ensure that the deviations are corrected.</H4></BODY></HTML>
