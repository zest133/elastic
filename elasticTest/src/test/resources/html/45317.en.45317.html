<H5 class=body1 align=justify><STRONG><EM><U>.6 Safe and efficient means of ascertaining the amount of oil fuel contained in any oil fuel tank shall be provided.</U></EM></STRONG></H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><STRONG><EM><U>.6.1 Where sounding pipes are used, they shall not terminate in any space where the risk of ignition of spillage from the sounding pipe might arise. In particular, they shall not terminate in passenger or crew spaces. As a general rule, they shall not terminate in machinery spaces. However, where the Administration considers that these latter requirements are impracticable, it may permit termination of sounding pipes in machinery spaces on condition that all the following requirements are met:</U></EM></STRONG></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><STRONG><EM><U>.6.1.1 in addition, an oil-level gauge is provided meeting the requirements of subparagraph .6.2;</U></EM></STRONG></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><STRONG><EM><U>.6.1.2 the sounding pipes terminate in locations remote from ignition hazards unless precautions are taken such as the fitting of effective screens to prevent the oil fuel in the case of spillage through the terminations of the sounding pipes from coming into contact with a source of ignition;</U></EM></STRONG></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><STRONG><EM><U>.6.1.3 the termination of sounding pipes are fitted with self-closing blanking devices and with a small-diameter self-closing control cock located below the blanking device for the purpose of ascertaining before the blanking device is opened that oil fuel is not present. Provision shall be made so as to ensure that any spillage of oil fuel through the control cock involves no ignition hazard.</U></EM></STRONG></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><STRONG><EM><U>.6.2 Other oil-level gauges may be used in place of sounding pipes. Such means, like the means provided in subparagraph .6.1.1, are subject to the following conditions:</U></EM></STRONG></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><STRONG><EM><U>.6.2.1 in passenger ships, such means shall not require penetration below the top of the tank and their failure or overfilling of the tanks shall not permit release of fuel;</U></EM></STRONG></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><STRONG><EM><U>.6.2.2 in cargo ships, the failure of such means or overfilling of the tank shall not permit release of fuel into the space. The use of cylindrical gauge glasses is prohibited. The Administration may permit the use of oil-level gauges with flat glasses and self-closing valves between the gauges and fuel tanks.</U></EM></STRONG></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><STRONG><EM><U>.6.3 Means prescribed in .6.2.1 or .6.2.2 which are acceptable to the Administration shall be maintained in the proper condition to ensure their continued accurate functioning in service.</U> <EM>(<IMG src="/images/icon/link.gif">replaced by </EM><A href="http://krcon.krs.co.kr/Generater/UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=40794&amp;NODE_TYPE=0&amp;IS_LEAF=True&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=False"><EM>Res.MSC.13(57)</EM></A><EM>)</EM></EM></STRONG></H6></BODY></HTML>
