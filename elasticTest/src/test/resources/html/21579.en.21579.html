<H2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=part>STABILITY</H2>
<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Regulation 5</H3>
<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Intact stability*</H3>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Code on Intact Stability for All Types of Ships covered by IMO Instruments, adopted by the Organization by <A href="UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=7240&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=true">resolution A.749(18)</A>, as amended. From 1 July 2010, the International Code on Intact Stability, 2008, adopted by <A href="UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=49219&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=false">resolution MSC.267(85)</A>, is expected to enter into force.</H6>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=subtitle>1 Every passenger ship regardless of size and every cargo ship having a length (L) of 24 m and upwards, shall be inclined upon its completion and the elements of its stability determined. <U>In addition to any other applicable requirements of the present regulations, ships having a length of 24 m and upwards constructed on or after 1 July 2010 shall as a minimum comply with the requirements of part A of the 2008 IS Code.</U> (<IMG alt="" src="/images/icon/link.gif">Added by <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=49218&amp;localekey=en">Res.MSC.269(85)</A>)</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 The Administration may allow the inclining test of an individual cargo ship to be dispensed with provided basic stability data are available from the inclining test of a sister ship and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that reliable stability information for the exempted ship can be obtained from such basic data, as required by regulation 5-1. A weight survey shall be carried out upon completion and the ship shall be inclined whenever in comparison with the data derived from the sister ship, a deviation from the lightship displacement exceeding 1% for ships of 160 m or more in length and 2% for ships of 50 m or less in length and as determined by linear interpolation for intermediate lengths or a deviation from the lightship longitudinal centre of gravity exceeding 0.5% of Ls is found.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=subtitle>3 The Administration may also allow the inclining test of an individual ship or class of ships especially designed for the carriage of liquids or ore in bulk to be dispensed with when reference to existing data for similar ships clearly indicates that due to the shipâ€™s proportions and arrangements more than sufficient metacentric height will be available in all probable loading conditions.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=subtitle>4 Where any alterations are made to a ship so as to materially affect the stability information supplied to the master, amended stability information shall be provided. If necessary the ship shall be re-inclined. The ship shall be re-inclined if anticipated deviations exceed one of the values specified in paragraph 5.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>5 At periodical intervals not exceeding five years, a lightweight survey shall be carried out on all passenger ships to verify any changes in lightship displacement and longitudinal centre of gravity. The ship shall be re-inclined whenever, in comparison with the approved stability information, a deviation from the lightship displacement exceeding 2% or a deviation of the longitudinal centre of gravity exceeding 1% of Ls is found or anticipated.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=subtitle>6 Every ship shall have scales of draughts marked clearly at the bow and stern. In the case where the draught marks are not located where they are easily readable, or operational constraints for a particular trade make it difficult to read the draught marks, then the ship shall also be fitted with a reliable draught indicating system by which the bow and stern draughts can be determined.</H4></BODY></HTML>
