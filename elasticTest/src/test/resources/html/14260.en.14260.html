<H3 class=regulation align=center>Emergency training and drills</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Subject Requirements applicable to passenger ships.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 This regulation applies to all ships.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Manuals</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>A training manual complying with the requirements of regulation 51 shall be provided in each crew mess room and recreation room or in each crew cabin.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Practice musters and drills</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 Each member of the crew shall participate in at least one abandon ship drill and one fire drill every month. The drills of the crew shall take place within 24 h of the ship leaving a port if more than 25% of the crew have not participated in abandon ship and fire drills on board that particular ship in the previous month. The Administration may accept other arrangements that are at least equivalent for those classes of ship for which this is impracticable.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 On a ship engaged on an international voyage which is not a short international voyage, musters of the passengers shall take place within 24 h after their embarkation. Passengers shall be instructed in the use of the life jackets and the action to take in an emergency. If only a small number of passengers embark at a port after the muster has been held it shall be sufficient, instead of holding another muster, to draw the attention of these passengers to the emergency instructions required by regulations 8.2 and 8.4.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.3 On a ship engaged on a short international voyage, if a muster of the passengers is not held on departure, the attention of the passengers shall be drawn to the emergency instructions required by regulations 8.2 and 8.4.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.4 Each abandon ship drill shall include:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 summoning of passengers and crew to muster stations with the alarm required by regulation 6.4.2 and ensuring that they are made aware of the order to abandon ship specified in the muster list;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 reporting to stations and preparing for the duties described in the muster list;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 checking that passengers and crew are suitably dressed;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 checking that life jackets are correctly donned;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 lowering of at least one lifeboat after any necessary preparation for launching;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6 starting and operating the lifeboat engine;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.7 operation of davits used for launching liferafts.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.5 Different lifeboats shall, as far as practicable, be lowered in compliance with the requirements of paragraph 3.4.5 at successive drills.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.6 Each lifeboat shall be launched with its assigned operating crew aboard and manoeuvred in the water at least once every 3 months during an abandon ship drill. The Administration may allow ships operating on short international voyages not to launch the lifeboats on one side if their berthing arrangements in port and their trading patterns do not permit launching of lifeboats on that side. However, all such lifeboats shall be lowered at least once every 3 months and launched at least annually.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.7 As far as is reasonable and practicable, rescue boats other than lifeboats which are also rescue boats shall be launched each month with their assigned crew aboard and manoeuvred in the water. In all cases this requirement shall be complied with at least once every 3 months.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.8 If lifeboat and rescue boat launching drills are carried out with the ship making headway, such drills shall, because of the dangers involved, be practised in sheltered waters only and under the supervision of an officer experienced in such drills.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.9 Emergency lighting for mustering and abandonment shall be tested at each abandon ship drill.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.10 Each fire drill shall include:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 reporting to stations and preparing for the duties described in the muster list required by regulation 8.3;</H6>

<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 checking fireman's outfits and other personal rescue equipment;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 checking the relevant communication equipment;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 checking the operation of watertight doors, fire doors, and fire dampers;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6 checking the necessary arrangements for subsequent abandonment of the ship.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.11 Fire drills should be planned in such a way that due consideration is given to regular practice in the various emergencies that may occur depending on the type of ship and its cargo.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.12 The equipment used during drills shall immediately be brought back to its fully operational condition, and any faults and defects discovered during the drills shall be remedied as soon as possible.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.13 Drills shall, as far as practicable, be conducted as if there were an actual emergency.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 On-board training and instructions</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 On-board training and instructions in the use of the ship's life-saving appliances, including survival craft equipment, and in the use of the ship's fire extinguishing appliances shall be given as soon as possible but not later than 2 weeks after a crew member joins the ship. However, if the crew member is on a regularly scheduled rotating assignment to the ship, such training shall be given not later than 2 weeks after the time of first joining the ship. Individual instruction may cover different parts of the ship's life-saving and fire extinguishing appliances, but all the ship's life-saving and fire-extinguishing appliances shall be covered within any period of 2 months.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 Each member of the crew shall be given instructions which shall include but not necessarily be limited to:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 operation and use of the ship's inflatable liferafts;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 problems of hypothermia, first-aid treatment of hypothermia and other appropriate first-aid procedures;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 special instructions necessary for use of the ship's life-saving appliances in severe weather and severe sea conditions;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 operation and use of fire-extinguishing appliances.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.3 On-board training in the use of davit-launched liferafts shall take place at intervals of not more than 4 months on every ship fitted with such appliances. Whenever practicable this shall include the inflation and lowering of a liferaft. This liferaft may be a special liferaft intended for training purposes only, which is not part of the ship's life-saving equipment: such a special liferaft shall be conspicuously marked.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Records</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>The date when musters are held, details of abandon ship drills and fire drills, drills of other life-saving appliances and on-board training shall be recorded in such log-book as may be prescribed by the Administration. If a full muster, drill or training session is not held at the appointed time, an entry shall be made in the log-book stating the circumstances and the extent of the muster, drill or training session held.</H4>
