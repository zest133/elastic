<H3 class=regulation align=center>Ventilation systems</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 The ventilation system of a passenger ship carrying more than 36 passengers shall, in addition to this part of this Regulation, also be in compliance with the requirements of Regulation 16.2 to 16.9.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 In general, the ventilation fans shall be so disposed that the ducts reaching the various spaces remain within the main vertical zone.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3 Where ventilation systems penetrate decks, precautions shall betaken, in addition to those relating to the fire integrity of the deck required by Regulations 18.1.1 and 30.5, to reduce the likelihood of smoke and hot gases passing from one 'tweendeck space to another through the system. In addition to insulation requirements contained in this Regulation, vertical ducts shall, if necessary, be insulated as required by the appropriate tables in Regulation 26.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.4 Except in cargo spaces, ventilation ducts shall be constructed of the following materials:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 ducts not less than 0.075m²in sectional area and all vertical ducts serving more than a single 'tweendeck space shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 ducts less than 0.075m²in sectional area other than the vertical ducts referred to in paragraph 1.4.1, shall be constructed of non-combustible materials. Where such ducts penetrate "A" or "B" class divisions due regard shall be given to ensuring the fire integrity of the division;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 short lengths of duct, not in general exceeding 0.02m²in sectional area nor 2 m in length, need not be non-combustible provided that all of the following conditions are met:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3.1 the duct is constructed of a material of low fire risk to the satisfaction of the Administration;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3.2 the duct is used only at the terminal end of the ventilation system; and</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3.3 the duct is not located closer than 600mmmeasured along its length to a penetration of an "A" or "B" class division, including continuous "B" class ceilings.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.5 Where a stairway enclosure is ventilated, the duct or ducts shall be taken from the fan room independently of other ducts in the ventilation system and shall not serve any other space.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.6 All power ventilation, except machinery space and cargo space ventilation an any alternative system which may be required under Regulation 16.6, shall be fitted with controls so grouped that all fans may be stopped from either of two separate positions which shall be situated as far apart as practicable. Controls provided for the power ventilation serving machinery spaces shall also be grouped so as to be operable from two positions, one of which shall be outside such spaces. Fans serving power ventilation systems to cargo spaces shall be capable of being stopped from a safe position outside such spaces.</H5>
