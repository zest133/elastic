<H3 class=regulation>Regulation 13</H3>
<H3 class=regulation>Fixed fire detection and fire alarm systems</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle>1 General requirements</H4>
<H5 class=body1>1.1 Any required fixed fire detection and fire alarm system with manually operated call points shall be capable of immediate operation at all times.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.2 Power supplies and electric circuits necessary for the operation of the system shall be monitored for loss of power or fault conditions as appropriate. Occurrence of a fault condition shall initiate a visual and audible fault signal at the control panel which shall be distinct from a fire signal.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.3 There shall be not less than two sources of power supply for the electrical equipment used in the operation of the fire detection and fire alarm system, one of which shall be an emergency source. The supply shall be provided by separate feeders reserved solely for that purpose. Such feeders shall run to an automatic change-over switch situated in or adjacent to the control panel for the fire detection system.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.4 Detectors and manually operated call points shall be grouped into sections. The activation of any detector or manually operated call point shall initiate a visual and audible fire signal at the control panel and indicating units. If the signals have not received attention within two minutes an audible alarm shall be automatically sounded throughout the crew accommodation and service spaces, control stations and machinery spaces of category A. This alarm sounder system need not be an integral part of the detection system.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.5 The control panel shall be located on the navigating bridge or in the main fire control station.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.6 Indicating units shall denote the section in which a detector or manually operated call point has operated. At least one unit shall be so located that it is easily accessible to responsible members of the crew at all times, when at sea or in port except when the ship is out of service. One indicating unit shall be located on the navigating bridge if the control panel is located in the main fire control station.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.7 Clear information shall be displayed on or adjacent to each indicating unit about the spaces covered and the location of the sections.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.8 No section covering more than one deck within accommodation, service and control stations shall normally be permitted except a section which covers an enclosed stairway. In order to avoid delay in identifying the source of fire, the number of enclosed spaces included in each section shall be limited as determined by the Administration. In no case shall more than fifty enclosed spaces be permitted in any section.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.9 In passenger ships a section of detectors shall not serve spaces on both sides of the ship nor on more than one deck and neither shall it be situated in more than one main vertical zone except that the Administration, if it is satisfied that the protection of the ship against fire will not thereby be reduced, may permit such a section of detectors to serve both sides of the ship and more than one deck.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.10 A section of fire detectors which covers a control station, a service space or an accommodation space shall not include a machinery space of category A.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.11 Detectors shall be operated by heat, smoke or other products of combustion, flame, or any combination of these factors. Detectors operated by other factors indicative of incipient fires may be considered by the Administration provided that they are no less sensitive than such detectors. Flame detectors shall only be used in addition to smoke or heat detectors.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.12 Suitable instructions and components spares for testing and maintenance shall be provided.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.13 The function of the detection system shall be periodically tested to the satisfaction of the Administration by means of equipment producing hot air at the appropriate temperature, or smoke or aerosol particles having the appropriate range of density or particle size, or other phenomena associated with incipient fires to which the detector is designed to respond. All detectors shall be of a type such that they can be tested for correct operation and restored to normal surveillance without the renewal of any component.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.14 The fire detection system shall not be used for any other purpose, except that closing of fire doors and similar functions may be permitted at the control panel. 2 Installation requirements</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>2.1 Manually operated call points shall be installed throughout the accommodation spaces, service spaces and control stations. One manually operated call point shall be located at each exit. Manually operated call points shall be readily accessible in the corridors of each deck such that no part of the corridor is more than 20 m from a manually operated call point.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>2.2 Smoke detectors shall be installed in all stairways, corridors and escape routes within accommodation spaces. Consideration shall be given to the installation of special purpose smoke detectors within ventilation ducting.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>2.3 Where a fixed fire detection and fire alarm system is required for the protection of spaces other than those specified in paragraph 2.2, at least one detector complying with paragraph 1.11 shall be installed in each such space.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>2.4 Detectors shall be located for optimum performance. Positions near beams and ventilation ducts or other positions where patterns of air flow could adversely affect performance and positions where impact or physical damage is likely shall be avoided. In general, detectors which are located on the overhead shall be a minimum distance of 0.5 m away from bulkheads.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>2.5 The maximum spacing of detectors shall be in accordance with the table below:</H4>

<H6 class=body2>The Administration may require or permit other spacings based upon test data which demonstrate the characteristics of the detectors.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle>2.6 Electrical wiring which forms part of the system shall be so arranged as to avoid galleys, machinery spaces of category A, and other enclosed spaces of high fire risk except where it is necessary to provide for fire detection or fire alarm in such spaces or to connect to the appropriate power supply.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>3 Design requirements</H4>
<H5 class=body1>3.1 The system and equipment shall be suitably designed to withstand supply voltage variation and transients, ambient temperature changes, vibration, humidity, shock, impact and corrosion normally encountered in ships.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>3.2 Smoke detectors required by paragraph 2.2 shall be certified to operate before the smoke density exceeds 12.5 per cent obscuration per metre, but not until the smoke density exceeds 2 per cent obscuration per metre. Smoke detectors to be installed in other spaces shall operate within sensitivity limits to the satisfaction of the Administration having regard to the avoidance of detector insensitivity or over sensitivity.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>3.3 Heat detectors shall be certified to operate before the temperature exceeds 78°C but not until the temperature exceeds 54°C, when the temperature is raised to those limits at a rate less than 1°C per minute. At higher rates of temperature rise, the heat detector shall operate within temperature limits to the satisfaction of the Administration having regard to the avoidance of detector insensitivity or over sensitivity.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>3.4 At the discretion of the Administration, the permissible temperature of operation of heat detectors may be increased to 30°C above the maximum deck head temperature in drying rooms and similar spaces of a normal high ambient temperature.</H5></BODY></HTML>
