<H3 class=regulation>Number and Capacity of Lifeboats and Liferafts</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle>(a)</H4>
<H5 class=body1>(i) Every cargo ship, except ships employed as whale factory ships, fish processing or canning factory ships, and ships engaged in the carriage of persons employed in the whaling, fish processing or canning industries, shall carry lifeboats on each side of the ship of such aggregate capacity as will accommodate all persons on board, and in addition shall carry liferafts sufficient to accommodate half that number. Provided that, in the case of such cargo ships engaged on international voyages between near neighbouring countries, the Administration, if it is satisfied that the conditions of the voyage are such as to render the compulsory carriage of liferafts unreasonable or unnecessary, may to that extent exempt individual ships or classes of ships from this requirement.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(ii)</H5>
<H6 class=body2>(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (ii)(2) of this paragraph, every tanker of 3,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall carry not less than four lifeboats, two of which shall be carried aft and two amidships, except that in tankers which have no amidships superstructure all lifeboats shall be carried aft.</H6>
<H6 class=body2>(2) A tanker of 3,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards which has no amidships superstructure may be permitted by the Administration to carry two lifeboats only, provided that:</H6>
<H6 class=body3>(aa) one lifeboat is carried aft on each side of the ship;</H6>
<H6 class=body3>(bb) each such lifeboat shall not exceed 8.5 metres (28 feet) in length;</H6>
<H6 class=body3>(cc) each such lifeboat shall be stowed as far forward as practicable, but at least so far forward that the after end of the lifeboat is one-and-a-half times the length of the lifeboat forward of the propeller; and</H6>
<H6 class=body3>(dd) each such lifeboat shall be stowed as near sea level as is safe and practicable.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle>(b)</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) Every ship employed as a whale factory ship, every ship employed as a fish processing or canning factory ship and every ship engaged in the carriage of persons employed in the whaling, fish processing or canning industries shall carry:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(1) Lifeboats on each side of such aggregate capacity as will accommodate half the total number of persons on board; provided that the Administration may permit the substitution of lifeboats by liferafts of the same total capacity so however that there shall never be less than sufficient lifeboats on each side of the ship to accommodate 37Â½ per cent of all on board.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(2) Liferafts of sufficient aggregate capacity to accommodate half the total number of persons on board. Provided that, if in ships employed as fish processing or canning factory ships, it is impracticable to carry lifeboats which comply fully with the requirements of this Chapter, the Administration may permit instead the carriage of other boats, which shall however provide not less than the accommodation required by this Regulation and shall have at least the buoyancy and equipment required by this Chapter for lifeboats.</H6>
<H5 class=body1>(ii) Every ship employed as a whale factory ship, every ship employed as a fish processing or canning factory ship and every ship engaged in the carriage of persons employed in the whaling, fish processing or canning industries shall carry two boats - one on each side - for use in an emergency. These boats shall be of an approved type and shall be not more than 8.5 metres (28 feet) in length. They may be counted for the purposes of this paragraph provided that they comply fully with the requirements for lifeboats of this Chapter and for the purposes of Regulation 8 provided that in addition they comply with the requirements of Regulation 9, and, where appropriate, Regulation 14 of this Chapter. They shall be kept ready for immediate use while the ship is at sea. In ships in which the requirements of paragraph (g) of Regulation 36 of this Chapter are met by means of appliances fitted to the sides of the lifeboats, such appliances shall not be required to be fitted to the two boats provided to meet the requirements of this Regulation.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>(c) Every cargo ship with no amidships superstructure having a registered length of 150 metres (492 feet) and upwards shall carry, in addition to the liferafts required under sub-paragraph (a)(i) of this Regulation, a liferaft capable of accommodating at least six persons which shall be stowed as far forward as is reasonable and practicable.</H4></BODY></HTML>
