<H3 class=regulation align=center>Alternative design and arrangement</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The goal of this regulation is to provide a methodology for alternative design and arrangements for structure, machinery, and electrical installations, fire safety and life-saving appliances and arrangements.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Structural arrangements, machinery and electrical installation, fire safety design and arrangement measures and as well as life-saving appliances and arrangements may deviate from the prescriptive requirements set out in chapters 3, 6, 7 and 8 of the Polar Code, provided that the alternative design and arrangements meet the intent of the goal and functional requirements concerned and provide an equivalent level of safety to the requirements in those chapters.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 When alternative designs or arrangements deviate from the prescriptive requirements of chapters 3, 6, 7 and 8 of the Polar Code, an engineering analysis, evaluation and approval of the design and arrangements shall be carried out based on the guidelines approved by the Organization<SUP>1</SUP>.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify><SUP>1</SUP> Refer to the <EM>Guidelines for the approval of alternatives and equivalents as provided for in various IMO instruments (</EM><A href="UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=58435&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=false"><EM>MSC.1/Circ.1455</EM></A><EM>), the Guidelines on alternative design and arrangements for SOLAS chapters II-1 and III (</EM><A href="UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=39187&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=false"><EM>MSC.1/Circ.1212</EM></A><EM>) and the Guidelines on alternative design and arrangements for fire safety (</EM><A href="UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=12823&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=false"><EM>MSC/Circ.1002</EM></A><EM>)</EM>, as applicable.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Any alternative designs or arrangement deviating from the prescriptive requirements shall be recorded in the Polar Ship Certificate and the ship's Polar Water Operational Manual, as required by the Polar Code, also defining the technical and operational measures and conditions for the allowed deviation.</H4>
