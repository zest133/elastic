<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Ro/ro cargo spaces</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 Fire detection</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>There shall be provided a fixed fire detection and fire alarm system complying with the requirements of regulation 13. The fixed fire detection system shall be capable of rapidly detecting the onset of fire. The type of detectors and their spacing and location shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration taking into account the effects of ventilation and other relevant factors. After being installed, the system shall be tested under normal ventilation conditions and shall give an overall response time to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 Fire-extinguishing arrangements</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>2.2.1 Ro-ro cargo spaces capable of being sealed shall be fitted with a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system which shall comply with the provisions of Regulation 5, except that:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1 if a carbon dioxide system is fitted, the quantity of gas available shall be at least sufficient to give a minimum volume of free gas equal to 45 per cent of the gross volume of the largest such cargo space which is capable of being sealed, and the arrangements shall be such as to ensure that at least two thirds of the gas required for the relevant space shall be introduced during 10 minutes;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2 a halogenated hydrocarbon system may be used only for spaces designated only for vehicles which are not carrying any cargo;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3 any other fixed gas fire-extinguishing system or fixed high expansion foam fire-extinguishing system may be fitted provided the Administration is satisfied that an equivalent protection is achieved;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.4 as an alternative, a system meeting the requirements of Regulation 37.1.3 may be fitted. However, the drainage and pumping arrangements shall be such as to prevent the build-up of free surfaces. If this is not possible the adverse effect upon stability of the added weight and free surface of water shall be taken into account to the extent deemed necessary by the Administration in its approval of the stability information.* Such information shall be included in the stability information supplied to the master as required by Regulation II-1/22.</H6>

<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Reference is made to Recommendation on Fixed Fire-Extinguishing Systems for Special Category Spaces, adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=6955&amp;localekey=en">A.123(V).</A></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>2.2.3 There shall be provided for use in any ro/ro cargo space such number of portable fire extinguishers as the Administration may deem sufficient. At least one portable extinguisher shall be located at each access to such a cargo space.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>2.2.4 Each ro/ro cargo space intended for the carriage of motor vehicles with fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion shall be provided with:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1 at least three water fog applicators;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2 one portable foam applicator unit complying with the provisions of Regulation 6.4 provided that at least two such units are available in the ship for use in such ro/ro cargo spaces.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3 Ventilation system</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>2.3.1 Closed ro/ro cargo spaces shall be provided with an effective power ventilation system sufficient to provide at least six air changes per hour based on an empty hold. Ventilation fans shall normally be run continuously whenever vehicles are on board. Where this is impracticable, they shall be operated for a limited period daily as weather permits and in any case for a reasonable period prior to discharge, after which period the ro/ro cargo space shall be proved gas free. One or more portable combustible gas detecting instruments shall be carried for this purpose. The system shall be entirely separate from other ventilating systems. Ventilation ducts serving ro/ro cargo spaces capable of being effectively sealed shall be separated for each cargo space. The Administration may require an increased number of air changes when vehicles are being loaded or unloaded. The system shall be capable of being controlled from a position outside such spaces.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>2.3.2 The ventilation shall be so arranged as to prevent air stratification and the formation of air pockets.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>2.3.3 Means shall be provided to indicate any loss of the required ventilating capacity on the navigating bridge.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>2.3.4 Arrangements shall be provided to permit a rapid shut-down and effective closure of the ventilation system in case of fire, taking into account the weather and sea conditions.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>2.3.5 Ventilation ducts, including dampers, shall be made of steel and their arrangement shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.4 Precautions against ignition of flammable vapours</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Closed ro/ro cargo spaces carrying motor vehicles with fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion shall comply with the following additional provisions:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 Except as provided in paragraph 2.4.2, electrical equipment and wiring shall be of a type suitable for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 Above a height of 450 mm from the deck and from each platform for vehicles, if fitted, except platforms with openings of sufficient size permitting penetration of petrol gases downwards, electrical equipment of a type so enclosed and protected as to prevent the escape of sparks shall be permitted as an alternative on condition that the ventilating system is so designed and operated as to provide continuous ventilation of the cargo spaces at the rate of at least 10 air changes per hour whenever vehicles are on board.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 Other equipment which may constitute a source of ignition of flammable vapours shall not be permitted.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 Electrical equipment and wiring in an exhaust ventilation duct shall be of a type approved for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures and the outlet from any exhaust duct shall be sited in a safe position, having regard to other possible sources of ignition.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 Scuppers shall not be led to machinery or other spaces where sources of ignition may be present.</H6></BODY></HTML>
