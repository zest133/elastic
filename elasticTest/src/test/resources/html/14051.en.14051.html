<H3 class=regulation align=center>Information required in Danger Messages</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>The following information is required in danger messages:</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Ice, Derelicts and other Direct Dangers to Navigation</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The kind of ice, derelict or danger observed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) The position of the ice, derelict or danger when last observed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) The time and date (Universal Co-ordinated Time) when danger last observed.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Tropical Storms (Hurricanes in the West Indies, Typhoons in the China Sea, Cyclones in Indian waters, and storms of a similar nature in other regions)</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) A statement that a tropical storm has been encountered. This obligation should be interpreted in a broad spirit, and information transmitted whenever the master has good reason to believe that a tropical storm is developing or exists in his neighbourhood.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Time, date (Universal Co-ordinated Time) and position of ship when the observation was taken.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) As much of the following information as is practicable should be included in the message:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>- barometric pressure,* preferably corrected (stating millibars, millimetres, or inches, and whether corrected or uncorrected);</H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* The standard international unit for barometic pressure is the hectopascal( hpa ) which is numerically equivalent to the millibar(mbar)</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>- barometric tendency (the change in barometric pressure during the past three hours);</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>- true wind direction;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>- wind force (beaufort scale) ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>- state of the sea (smooth, moderate, rough, high);</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>- swell (slight, moderate, heavy) and the true direction from which it comes. Period or length of swell (short, average, long) would also be of value;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>- true course and speed of ship.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Subsequent Observations</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>When a master has reported a tropical or other dangerous storm, it is desirable, but not obligatory, that further observations be made and transmitted hourly, if practicable, but in any case at intervals of not more than three hours, so long as the ship remains under the influence of the storm.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) Winds of force 10 or above on the Beaufort scale for which no storm warning has been received. This is intended to deal with storms other than the tropical storms referred to in paragraph (b) of this Regulation; when such a storm is encountered, the message should contain similar information to that listed under that paragraph but excluding the details concerning sea and swell.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) Sub-freezing air temperatures associated with gale force winds causing severe ice accretion on superstructures</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Time and date (Universal Co-ordinated Time).</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Air temperature.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) Sea temperature (if practicable).</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) Wind force and direction.</H5>
