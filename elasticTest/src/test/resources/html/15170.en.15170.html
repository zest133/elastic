<H3 class=regulation align=center>Damage stability requirements applicable to bulk carriers</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Bulk carriers of 150m in length and upwards of single side skin construction, designed to carry solid bulk cargoes having a density of 1000 kg/m³and above, constructed on or after 1 July 1999 shall, when loaded to the summer load line, be able to withstand flooding of any one cargo hold in all loading conditions and remain afloat in a satisfactory condition of equilibrium, as specified in paragraph 3.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Bulk carriers of 150m in length and upwards of single side skin construction, carrying solid bulk cargoes having a density of 1780 kg/m³and above, constructed before 1 July 1999 shall, when loaded to the summer load line, be able to withstand flooding of the foremost cargo hold in all loading conditions and remain afloat in a satisfactory condition of equilibrium, as specified in paragraph 3. This requirement shall be complied with in accordance with the implementation schedule specified in regulation 3.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Subject to the provisions of paragraph 6, the condition of equilibrium after flooding shall satisfy the condition of equilibrium laid down in the annex to resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7006&amp;localekey=en">A.320(IX)-</A>Regulation equivalent to regulation 27 of the International convention on Load Lines, 1966, as amended by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7095&amp;localekey=en">A.514(13). </A>The assumed flooding need only take into account flooding of the cargo hold space. The permeability of a loaded hold shall be assumed as 0.9 and the permeability of an empty hold shall be assumed as 0.95, unless a permeability relevant to a particular cargo is assumed for the volume of a flooded hold occupied by cargo and a permeability of 0.95 is assumed for the remaining empty volume of the hold.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Bulk carriers constructed before 1 July 1999 which have been assigned a reduced freeboard in compliance with regulation 27(7) of the International convention on Load Lines, 1966, as adopted on 5 April 1966, may be considered as complying with paragraph 2 of this regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Bulk carriers which have been assigned a reduced freeboard in compliance with the provisions of paragraph(8) of the regulation equivalent to regulation 27 of the International convention on Load Lines, 1966, adopted by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7006&amp;localekey=en">A.320(IX), </A>as amended by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7095&amp;localekey=en">A.514(13), </A>may be considered as complying with paragraphs 1 or 2, as appropriate.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 On bulk carriers which have been assigned reduced freeboard in compliance with the provisions of regulation 27(8) set out in Annex B of the Protocol of 1988 relating to the International convention on Load Lines, 1966, the condition of equilibrium after flooding shall satisfy the relevant provisions of that Protocol.</H4></BODY></HTML>
