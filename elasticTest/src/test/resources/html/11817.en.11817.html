<H3 class=regulation align=center>Calculation of the factor s<SUB>i</SUB></H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The factor <EM>s<SUB>i</SUB> </EM>shall be determined for each case of assumed flooding, involving a compartment or group of compartments, in accordance with the following notations and the provisions in this regulation.</H4>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>θ<SUB>e</SUB></EM> is the equilibrium heel angle in any stage of flooding, in degrees;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>θ<SUB>v</SUB></EM> is the angle, in any stage of flooding, where the righting lever becomes negative, or the angle at which an opening incapable of being closed weathertight becomes submerged;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>GZ<SUB>max</SUB></EM> is the maximum positive righting lever, in metres, up to the angle <EM>θ<SUB>v</SUB></EM>;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>Range</EM> is the range of positive righting levers, in degrees, measured from the angle <EM>θ<SUB>e</SUB></EM>. The positive range is to be taken up to the angle <EM>θ<SUB>v</SUB></EM>;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>Flooding stage</EM> is any discrete step during the flooding process, including the stage before equalization (if any) until final equilibrium has been reached.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 The factor <EM>s<SUB>i</SUB></EM>, for any damage case at any initial loading condition, <EM>d<SUB>i</SUB></EM>, shall be obtained from the formula:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>s<SUB>i</SUB> = minimum {s<SUB>intermediate, i</SUB> or s<SUB>final, i</SUB>·s<SUB>mom,i</SUB>}</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>where:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>s<SUB>intermediate, i</SUB> is the probability to survive all intermediate flooding stages until the final equilibrium stage, and is calculated in accordance with paragraph 2;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>s<SUB>final, i</SUB> is the probability to survive in the final equilibrium stage of flooding. It is calculated in accordance with paragraph 3;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>s<SUB>mom,i</SUB> is the probability to survive heeling moments, and is calculated in accordance with paragraph 4.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2 The factor s<SUB>intermediate, i</SUB> is applicable only to passenger ships (for cargo ships s<SUB>intermediate, i</SUB> should be taken as unity) and shall be taken as the least of the s-factors obtained from all flooding stages including the stage before equalization, if any, and is to be calculated as follows:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><IMG border=0 hspace=0 alt="" align=baseline src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.a6.a01.021.0702/en/reg7-2_7.jpg"></H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>where GZ<SUB>max</SUB> is not to be taken as more than 0.05 m and <EM>Range</EM> as not more than 7°. s<SUB>intermediate</SUB> = 0 if the intermediate heel angle exceeds 15º. Where cross-flooding fittings are required, the time for equalization shall not exceed 10 min.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3 The factor s<SUB>final, i</SUB> shall be obtained from the formula:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><IMG border=0 hspace=0 alt="" align=baseline src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.a6.a01.021.0702/en/reg7-2_27.jpg"></H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>where:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>GZmax</EM> is not to be taken as more than 0.12 m;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>Range</EM> is not to be taken as more than 16°;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><IMG border=0 hspace=0 alt="" align=baseline src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.a6.a01.021.0702/en/reg7-2_26.jpg"></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>where:</H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify><IMG border=0 hspace=0 alt="" align=baseline src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.a6.a01.021.0702/en/reg7-2_33.jpg"> is 7° for passenger ships and 25° for cargo ships; and</H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify><IMG border=0 hspace=0 alt="" align=baseline src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.a6.a01.021.0702/en/reg7-2_33.jpg"> is 15° for passenger ships and 30° for cargo ships.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4 The factor&nbsp;s<SUB>mom,i</SUB> is applicable only to passenger ships (for cargo ships&nbsp;s<SUB>mom,i</SUB> shall be taken as unity) and shall be calculated at the final equilibrium from the formula:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><IMG border=0 hspace=0 alt="" align=baseline src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.a6.a01.021.0702/en/reg7-2_30.jpg"></H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>where:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>Displacement</EM> is the intact displacement at the subdivision draught;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>M<SUB>heel</SUB> is the maximum assumed heeling moment as calculated in accordance with subparagraph 4.1; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>s<SUB>mom,i</SUB> ≤ 1</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 The heeling moment&nbsp;M<SUB>heel</SUB> is to be calculated as follows:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>M<SUB>heel</SUB> = maximum{M<SUB>passenger</SUB> or M<SUB>wind</SUB> or M<SUB>survivalcraft</SUB>}</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1.1&nbsp;M<SUB>passenger</SUB> is the maximum assumed heeling moment resulting from movement of passengers, and is to be obtained as follows:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>M<SUB>passenger</SUB> = (0.075·N<SUB>p</SUB>)·(0.45·B)&nbsp; (t·m)</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>where:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>N<SUB>p</SUB></EM> is the maximum number of passengers permitted to be on board in the service condition corresponding to the deepest subdivision draught under consideration; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>B</EM> is the beam of the ship.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Alternatively, the heeling moment may be calculated assuming the passengers are distributed with 4 persons per square metre on available deck areas towards one side of the ship on the decks where muster stations are located and in such a way that they produce the most adverse heeling moment. In doing so, a weight of 75 kg per passenger is to be assumed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1.2&nbsp;M<SUB>wind</SUB> is the maximum assumed wind force acting in a damage situation:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>M<SUB>wind</SUB> = (P·A·Z)/9,806&nbsp; (t·m)</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>where:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>P</EM> = 120 N/m<SUP>2</SUP>;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>A</EM> = projected lateral area above waterline;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>Z</EM> = distance from centre of lateral projected area above waterline to <EM>T/2</EM>; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>T</EM> = ship’s draught, <EM>d<SUB>i</SUB></EM>.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1.3&nbsp;M<SUB>survivalcraft</SUB> is the maximum assumed heeling moment due to the launching of all fully loaded davit-launched survival craft on one side of the ship. It shall be calculated using the following assumptions:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 all lifeboats and rescue boats fitted on the side to which the ship has heeled after having sustained damage shall be assumed to be swung out fully loaded and ready for lowering;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 for lifeboats which are arranged to be launched fully loaded from the stowed position, the maximum heeling moment during launching shall be taken;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 a fully loaded davit-launched liferaft attached to each davit on the side to which the ship has heeled after having sustained damage shall be assumed to be swung out ready for lowering;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 persons not in the life-saving appliances which are swung out shall not provide either additional heeling or righting moment; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 life-saving appliances on the side of the ship opposite to the side to which the ship has heeled shall be assumed to be in a stowed position.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5 Unsymmetrical flooding is to be kept to a minimum consistent with the efficient arrangements. Where it is necessary to correct large angles of heel, the means adopted shall, where practicable, be self-acting, but in any case where controls to equalization devices are provided they shall be operable from above the bulkhead deck. These fittings together with their controls shall be acceptable to the Administration.* Suitable information concerning the use of equalization devices shall be supplied to the master of the ship.</H5>

<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Reference is made to the Recommendation on a standard method for establishing compliance with the requirements for cross-flooding arrangements in passengers ships, adopted by the Organization by <A href="UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=6987&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=true">resolution A.266(VIII)</A>, as may be amended.</H6></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.1 Tanks and compartments taking part in such equalization shall be fitted with air pipes or equivalent means of sufficient cross-section to ensure that the flow of water into the equalization compartments is not delayed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.2 In all cases, <EM>si</EM> is to be taken as zero in those cases where the final waterline, taking into account sinkage, heel and trim, immerses:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 the lower edge of openings through which progressive flooding may take place and such flooding is not accounted for in the calculation of factor si. Such openings shall include air-pipes, ventilators and openings which are closed by means of weathertight doors or hatch covers; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 any part of the bulkhead deck in passenger ships considered a horizontal evacuation route for compliance with chapter II-2.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.3 The factor <EM>si </EM>is to be taken as zero if, taking into account sinkage, heel and trim, any of the following occur in any intermediate stage or in the final stage of flooding:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 immersion of any vertical escape hatch in the bulkhead deck intended for compliance with chapter II-2;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 any controls intended for the operation of watertight doors, equalization devices, valves on piping or on ventilation ducts intended to maintain the integrity of watertight bulkheads from above the bulkhead deck become inaccessible or inoperable;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 immersion of any part of piping or ventilation ducts carried through a watertight boundary that is located within any compartment included in damage cases contributing to the attained index <EM>A</EM>, if not fitted with watertight means of closure at each boundary.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.4 However, where compartments assumed flooded due to progressive flooding are taken into account in the damage stability calculations multiple values of&nbsp;s<SUB>intermediate, i</SUB>&nbsp;may be calculated assuming equalization in additional flooding phases.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.5 Except as provided in paragraph 5.3.1, openings closed by means of watertight manhole covers and flush scuttles, small watertight hatch covers, remotely operated sliding watertight doors, side scuttles of the non-opening type as well as watertight access doors and hatch covers required to be kept closed at sea need not be considered.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6 Where horizontal watertight boundaries are fitted above the waterline under consideration the s-value calculated for the lower compartment or group of compartments shall be obtained by multiplying the value as determined in paragraph 1.1 by the reduction factor <IMG border=0 hspace=0 alt="" align=baseline src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.a6.a01.021.0702/en/reg7-2_24.jpg"> according to paragraph 6.1, which represents the probability that the spaces above the horizontal subdivision will not be flooded.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.1 The factor&nbsp;v<SUB>m<EM></EM></SUB> shall be obtained from the formula:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>v<SUB>m</SUB> = v(H<SUB>j, n, m</SUB>, d) - v(H<SUB>j, n, m-1</SUB>, d)</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>where:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM></EM>H<SUB>j, n, m</SUB>&nbsp;is the least height above the baseline, in metres, within the longitudinal range of&nbsp;x<SUB>1(j)</SUB>...x<SUB>2(j+n-1)<EM></EM></SUB> of the&nbsp;m<SUP>th</SUP> horizontal boundary which is assumed to limit the vertical extent of flooding for the damaged compartments under consideration;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM></EM>H<SUB>j, n, m-1</SUB>&nbsp;is the least height above the baseline, in metres, within the longitudinal range of&nbsp;x<SUB>1(j)</SUB>...x<SUB>2(j+n-1)</SUB> of the&nbsp;(m-1)<SUP>th</SUP> horizontal boundary which is assumed to limit the vertical extent of flooding for the damaged compartments under consideration;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>j</EM> signifies the aft terminal of the damaged compartments under consideration; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>m</EM> represents each horizontal boundary counted upwards from the waterline under consideration;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>d</EM> is the draught in question as defined in regulation 2; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM>x<SUB>1</SUB></EM>and <EM>x<SUB>2</SUB></EM>represent the terminals of the compartment or group of compartments considered in regulation 7-1.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.1.1 The factors&nbsp;v(H<SUB>j, n, m</SUB>, d)&nbsp;and&nbsp;v(H<SUB>j, n, m-1</SUB>, d)&nbsp;shall be obtained from the formulae:</H5>

<H5 class=body1 align=justify>where:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><EM></EM>v(H<SUB>j, n, m</SUB>, d)&nbsp;is to be taken as 1, if&nbsp;H<SUB>m</SUB> coincides with the uppermost watertight boundary of the ship within the range&nbsp;x<SUB>1(j)</SUB>...x<SUB>2(j+n-1)<EM></EM></SUB>, and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>v(H<SUB>j, n, 0</SUB>, d) is to be taken as 0.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>In no case is vm to be taken as less than zero or more than 1.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.2 In general, each contribution <EM>dA</EM> to the index <EM>A</EM> in the case of horizontal subdivisions is obtained from the formula:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>dA = p<SUB>i</SUB> · [v<SUB>1</SUB> · s<SUB>min1</SUB> + (v<SUB>2</SUB> - v<SUB>1</SUB>) · s<SUB>min2</SUB> + ··· + (1-v<SUB>m-1</SUB>) · s<SUB>min<EM>m</EM></SUB>]</H6>
