<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Except in cargo spaces, mail rooms, baggage rooms, or refrigerated compartments of service spaces, all linings, grounds, draft stops, ceilings and insulation shall be of non-combustible materials. Partial bulkheads or decks used to subdivide a space for utility or artistic treatment shall also be of non-combustible material.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Vapour barriers and adhesives used in conjunction with insulation, as well as insulation of pipe fittings, for cold service systems need not be non-combustible, but they shall be kept to the minimum quantity practicable and their exposed surfaces shall have low flame spread characteristics.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 The following surfaces shall have low flame-spread characteristics*:5)</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Guidelines on the evaluation of fire hazard properties of materials, adopted by the Organization by resolution A.166(ES.IV), and to the Recommendation on Improved Fire Test Procedures for Surface Flammability of Bulkhead, Ceiling and Deck Finish Materials adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7174&amp;localekey=en">A.653(16).</A></H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 exposed surfaces in corridors and stairway enclosures, and of bulkheads, wall and ceiling linings in all accommodation and service spaces and control stations;</H5>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 The total volume of combustible facings, mouldings, decorations and veneers in any accommodation and service spaces shall not exceed a volume equivalent to 2.5mm veneer on the combined area of the walls and ceilings. In the case of ships fitted with an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of Regulation 12, the above volume may include some combustible material used for erection of "C" class divisions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5. Veneers used on surfaces and linings covered by the requirements of paragraph 3 shall have a calorific value** not exceeding 45 MJ/mÂ²of the area for the thickness used.6)</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>** The gross calorific value measured in accordance with ISO standard 1716-"Building Materials-Determination of Calorific Potential', should be quoted.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Furniture in stairway enclosures shall be limited to seating. It shall be fixed, limited to six seats on each deck in each stairway enclosure, be of restricted fire risk, and shall not restrict the passenger escape route. The Administration may permit additional seating in the main reception area within a stairway enclosure if it is fixed, non-combustible and does not restrict the passenger escape route. Furniture shall not be permitted in passenger and crew corridors forming escape routes in cabin area. In addition to the above, lockers of non-combustible material, providing storage for safety equipment required by regulations, may be permitted.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Paints, varnishes and other finishes used on exposed interior surfaces shall not be capable of producing excessive quantities of smoke and toxic products, this being determined in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 Primary deck coverings, if applied within accommodation and service spaces and control stations, shall be of an approved material which will not readily ignite or give rise to toxic or explosive hazards at elevated temperatures, this being determined in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code.</H4></BODY></HTML>
