<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Regulation 55</H3>
<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Alternative design and arrangements</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>1 Purpose</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>The purpose of this regulation is to provide a methodology for alternative design and arrangements for machinery and electrical installations.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 General</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.1 Machinery and electrical installation design and arrangements may deviate from the requirements set out in parts C, D and E, provided that the alternative design and arrangements meet the intent of the requirements concerned and provide an equivalent level of safety to this chapter.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.2 When alternative design or arrangements deviate from the prescriptive requirements of parts C, D and E, an engineering analysis, evaluation and approval of the design and arrangements shall be carried out in accordance with this regulation.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 Engineering analysis</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>The engineering analysis shall be prepared and submitted to the Administration, based on the guidelines developed by the Organization<STRONG>*</STRONG> and shall include, as a minimum, the following elements:</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=footnote><STRONG>*</STRONG> Refer to the Guidelines on alternative design and arrangements for SOLAS chapters II-1 and III (<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=39187&amp;localekey=en">MSC.1/Circ.1212</A>).</H6></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 determination of the ship type, machinery, electrical installations and space(s) concerned;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 identification of the prescriptive requirement(s) with which the machinery and electrical installations will not comply;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.3 identification of the reason the proposed design will not meet the prescriptive requirements supported by compliance with other recognized engineering or industry standards;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.4 determination of the performance criteria for the ship, machinery, electrical installation or the space(s) concerned addressed by the relevant prescriptive requirement(s):</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.1 performance criteria shall provide a level of safety not inferior to the relevant prescriptive requirements contained in parts C, D and E; and</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.2 performance criteria shall be quantifiable and measurable;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.5 detailed description of the alternative design and arrangements, including a list of the assumptions used in the design and any proposed operational restrictions or conditions;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.6 technical justification demonstrating that the alternative design and arrangements meet the safety performance criteria; and</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.7 risk assessment based on identification of the potential faults and hazards associated with the proposal.</H6>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4 Evaluation of the alternative design and arrangements</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4.1 The engineering analysis required in paragraph 3 shall be evaluated and approved by the Administration, taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization.<STRONG>*</STRONG></H5>

<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4.2 A copy of the documentation, as approved by the Administration, indicating that the alternative design and arrangements comply with this regulation, shall be carried on board the ship.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>5 Exchange of information</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>The Administration shall communicate to the Organization pertinent information concerning alternative design and arrangements approved by them for circulation to all Contracting Governments.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>6 Re-evaluation due to change of conditions</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>If the assumptions and operational restrictions that were stipulated in the alternative design and arrangements are changed, the engineering analysis shall be carried out under the changed condition and shall be approved by the Administration.‚Äù</H5>
