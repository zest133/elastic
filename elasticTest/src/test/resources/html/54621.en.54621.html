<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.1.1 Ventilation ducts, including single and double wall ducts, shall be of steel or equivalent material except flexible bellows of short length not exceeding 600 mm used for connecting fans to the ducting in air-conditioning rooms. Unless expressly provided otherwise in paragraph 7.1.6, any other material used in the construction of ducts, including insulation, shall also be non-combustible. However, short ducts, not generally exceeding 2 m in length and with a free cross-sectional area* not exceeding 0.02 m<SUP>2</SUP>, need not be of steel or equivalent material, subject to the following conditions:</U></H6>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* The term free cross-sectional area means, even in the case of a pre-insulated duct, the area calculated on the basis of the inner dimensions of the duct itself and not the insulation.</H6>

<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.1 the ducts shall be made of non-combustible material, which may be faced internally and externally with membranes having low flame-spread characteristics and, in each case, a calorific value** not exceeding 45 MJ/m<SUP>2</SUP> of their surface area for the thickness used;</U></H6>

<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.2 the ducts are only used at the end of the ventilation device; and</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.3 the ducts are not situated less than 600 mm, measured along the duct, from an opening in an "A" or "B" class division, including continuous "B" class ceiling.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.1.2 The following arrangements shall be tested in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code:</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.1 fire dampers, including their relevant means of operation, however, the testing is not required for dampers located at the lower end of the duct in exhaust ducts for galley ranges, which must be of steel and capable of stopping the draught in the duct; and</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.2 duct penetrations through "A" class divisions. However, the test is not required where steel sleeves are directly joined to ventilation ducts by means of riveted or screwed connections or by welding.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.1.3 Fire dampers shall be easily accessible. Where they are placed behind ceilings or linings, these ceilings or linings shall be provided with an inspection hatch on which the identification number of the fire damper is marked. The fire damper identification number shall also be marked on any remote controls provided.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.1.4 Ventilation ducts shall be provided with hatches for inspection and cleaning. The hatches shall be located near the fire dampers.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.1.5 The main inlets and outlets of ventilation systems shall be capable of being closed from outside the spaces being ventilated. The means of closing shall be easily accessible as well as prominently and permanently marked and shall indicate the operating position of the closing device.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.1.6 Combustible gaskets in flanged ventilation duct connections are not permitted within 600 mm of openings in "A" or "B" class divisions and in ducts required to be of "A" class construction.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.1.7 Ventilation openings or air balance ducts between two enclosed spaces shall not be provided except as permitted by paragraphs 4.1.2.1 and 4.2.3.</U></H6>
