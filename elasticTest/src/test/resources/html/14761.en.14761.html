<H4 class=subtitle align=left>For the purpose of this Chapter, unless expressly provided otherwise:</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 "Non-combustible material" is a material which neither burns nor gives off flammable vapours in sufficient quantity for self-ignition when heated to approximately 750°C, this being determined in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code. Any other material is a combustible material.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 "A standard fire test" is one in which the specimens of the relevant bulkheads and decks are exposed in a test furnace to temperatures corresponding approximately to the standard time-temperature curve. The test methods shall be in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 "A class divisions" are those divisions formed by bulkheads and decks which comply with the following:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 they shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 they shall be suitably stiffened;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 they shall be so constructed as to be capable of preventing the passage of smoke and flame to the end of the one-hour standard fire test;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 they shall be insulated with approved non-combustible materials such that the average temperature of the unexposed side will not rise more than 140°C above the original temperature, nor will the temperature, at any one point, including any joint, rise more than 180°C above the original temperature, within the time listed below:</H5>
