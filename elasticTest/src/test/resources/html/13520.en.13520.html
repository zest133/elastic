<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Stability information for passenger ships and cargo ships *</H3>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=footnote>* Refer to the Code on Intact Stability for All Types of Ships Covered by IMO Instruments adopted by the Organization by <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7240&amp;localekey=en">resolution A.749(18)</A> as amended by resolution MSC.75(69). Refer also to: <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12507&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.456</A>, Guidelines for the preparation of intact stability information; <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12651&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.706</A>, Guidance on intact stability of existing tankers during transfer operations; and <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12652&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.707</A>, Guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in following and quartering seas. </H6>

<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>1 Every passenger ship regardless of size and every cargo ship having a length, as defined in the International Convention on Load Lines in force, of 24m and upwards shall be inclined upon its completion and the elements of its stability determined. The master shall be supplied with such information satisfactory to the Administration as is necessary to enable him by rapid and simple processes to obtain accurate guidance as to the stability of the ship under varying conditions of service. A copy of the stability information shall be furnished to the Administration.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 Where any alterations are made to a ship so as to materially affect the stability information supplied to the master, amended stability information shall be provided. If necessary the ship shall be re-inclined.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 At periodical intervals not exceeding five years, a lightweight survey shall be carried out on all passenger ships to verify any changes in lightship displacement and longitudinal centre of gravity. The ship shall be re-inclined whenever, in comparison with the approved stability information, a deviation from the lightship displacement exceeding 2% or a deviation of the longitudinal centre of gravity exceeding 1% of L is found or anticipated.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4 The Administration may allow the inclining test of an individual ship to be dispensed with provided basic stability data are available from the inclining test of a sister ship and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Adminstration that reliable stability information for the exempted ship can be obtained from such basic data, as required by paragraph 1.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>5 The Administration may allow the inclining test of an individual ship or class of ship especially designed for the carriage of liquids or ore in bulk to be dispensed with when reference to existing data for similar ships clearly indicates that due to the ship's proportions and arrangements more than sufficient metacentric height will be available in all probable loading conditions.</H4></BODY></HTML>
