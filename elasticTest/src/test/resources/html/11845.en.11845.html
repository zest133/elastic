<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 15</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Openings in the shell plating below the bulkhead deck of passenger ships and the freeboard deck of cargo ships</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>1 The number of openings in the shell plating shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>2 The arrangement and efficiency of the means for closing any opening in the shell plating shall be consistent with its intended purpose and the position in which it is fitted and generally to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.1 Subject to the requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines in force, no sidescuttle shall be fitted in such a position that its sill is below a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point 2.5% of the breadth of the ship above the deepest subdivision draught, or 500 mm, whichever is the greater.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>3.2 All sidescuttles the sills of which are below the bulkhead deck of passenger ships and the freeboard deck of cargo ships, as permitted by paragraph 3.1, shall be of such construction as will effectively prevent any person opening them without the consent of the master of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Efficient hinged inside deadlights so arranged that they can be easily and effectively closed and secured watertight, shall be fitted to all sidescuttles except that abaft one eighth of the ship's length from the forward perpendicular and above a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point at a height of 3.7 m plus 2.5% of the breadth of the ship above the deepest subdivision draught, the deadlights may be portable in passenger accommodation other than that for steerage passengers, unless the deadlights are required by the International Convention on Load Lines in force to be permanently attached in their proper positions. Such portable deadlights shall be stowed adjacent to the sidescuttles they serve.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>5.1 No sidescuttles shall be fitted in any spaces which are appropriated exclusively to the carriage of cargo or coal.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>5.2 Sidescuttles may, however, be fitted in spaces appropriated alternatively to the carriage of cargo or passengers, but they shall be of such construction as will effectively prevent any person opening them or their deadlights without the consent of the master.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>6 Automatic ventilating sidescuttles shall not be fitted in the shell plating below the bulkhead deck of passenger ships and the freeboard deck of cargo ships without the special sanction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>7 The number of scuppers, sanitary discharges and other similar openings in the shell plating shall be reduced to the minimum either by making each discharge serve for as many as possible of the sanitary and other pipes, or in any other satisfactory manner.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>8.1 All inlets and discharges in the shell plating shall be fitted with efficient and accessible arrangements for preventing the accidental admission of water into the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>8.2.1 Subject to the requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines in force, and except as provided in paragraph 8.3, each separate discharge led through the shell plating from spaces below the bulkhead deck of passenger ships and the freeboard deck of cargo ships shall be provided with either one automatic non-return valve fitted with a positive means of closing it from above the bulkhead deck or with two automatic non-return valves without positive means of closing, provided that the inboard valve is situated above the deepest subdivision draught and is always accessible for examination under service conditions. Where a valve with positive means of closing is fitted, the operating position above the bulkhead deck shall always be readily accessible and means shall be provided for indicating whether the valve is open or closed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>8.2.2 The requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines in force shall apply to discharges led through the shell plating from spaces above the bulkhead deck of passenger ships and the freeboard deck of cargo ships.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>8.3 Machinery space, main and auxiliary sea inlets and discharges in connection with the operation of machinery shall be fitted with readily accessible valves between the pipes and the shell plating or between the pipes and fabricated boxes attached to the shell plating. In manned machinery spaces the valves may be controlled locally and shall be provided with indicators showing whether they are open or closed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>8.4 Moving parts penetrating the shell plating below the deepest subdivision draught shall be fitted with a watertight sealing arrangement acceptable to the Administration. The inboard gland shall be located within a watertight space of such volume that, if flooded, the bulkhead deck will not be submerged. The Administration may require that if such compartment is flooded, essential or emergency power and lighting, internal communication, signals or other emergency devices must remain available in other parts of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>8.5 All shell fittings and valves required by this regulation shall be of steel, bronze or other approved ductile material. Valves of ordinary cast iron or similar material are not acceptable. All pipes to which this regulation refers shall be of steel or other equivalent material to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>9 Gangway, cargo and fuelling ports fitted below the bulkhead deck of passenger ships and the freeboard deck of cargo ships shall be watertight and in no case be so fitted as to have their lowest point below the deepest subdivision draught.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>10.1 The inboard opening of each ash-chute, rubbish-chute, etc., shall be fitted with an efficient cover.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>10.2 If the inboard opening is situated below the bulkhead deck of passenger ships and the freeboard deck of cargo ships, the cover shall be watertight and, in addition, an automatic non-return valve shall be fitted in the chute in an easily accessible position above the deepest subdivision draught.</H4>
