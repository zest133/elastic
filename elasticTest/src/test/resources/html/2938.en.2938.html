<H3 class=regulation align=center>Venting, purging, gas freeing and ventilation</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Cargo tank venting</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 The venting systems of cargo tanks are to be entirely distinct from the air pipes of the other compartments of the ship. The arrangements and position of openings in the cargo tank deck from which emission of flammable vapours can occur shall be such as to minimize the possibility of flammable vapours being admitted to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition, or collecting in the vicinity of deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard. In accordance with this general principle the criteria in paragraphs 1.2 to 1.10 will apply.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 The venting arrangements shall be so designed and operated as to ensure that neither pressure nor vacuum in cargo tanks shall exceed design parameters and be such as to provide for:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 the flow of the small volumes of vapour, air or inert gas mixtures caused by thermal variations in a cargo tank in all cases through pressure/vacuum valves; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 the passage of large volumes of vapour, air or inert gas mixtures during cargo loading and ballasting, or during discharging.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3.1 The venting arrangements in each cargo tank may be independent or combined with other cargo tanks and may be incorporated into the inert gas piping.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3.2 Where the arrangements are combined with other cargo tanks either stop valves or other acceptable means shall be provided to isolate each cargo tank. Where stop valves are fitted, they shall be provided with locking arrangements which shall be under the control of the responsible ship's officer. Any isolation must continue to permit the flow caused by thermal variations in a cargo tank in accordance with paragraph 1.2.1.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.4 The venting arrangements shall be connected to the top of each cargo tank and shall be self-draining to the cargo tanks under all normal conditions of trim and list of the ship. Where it may not be possible to provide self-draining lines permanent arrangements shall be provided to drain the vent lines to a cargo tank.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.5 The venting system shall be provided with devices to prevent the passage of flame into the cargo tanks. The design, testing and locating of these devices shall comply with the requirements established by the Administration which shall contain at least the standards adopted by the Organization.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.6 Provision shall be made to guard against liquid rising in the venting system to a height which would exceed the design head of cargo tanks. This shall be accomplished by high level alarms or overflow control systems or other equivalent means, together with gauging devices and cargo tank filling procedures.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.7 Openings for pressure release required by paragraph 1.2.1 shall:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 have as great a height as is practicable above the cargo tank deck to obtain maximum dispersal of flammable vapours but in no case less than 2 m above the cargo tank deck;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 be arranged at the furthest distance practicable but not less than 5 m from the nearest air intakes and openings to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition and from deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.8 Pressure/vacuum valves required by paragraph 1.2.1 may be provided with a by-pass arrangement when they are located in a vent main or masthead riser. Where such an arrangement is provided there shall be suitable indicators to show whether the by-pass is open or closed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.9 Vent outlets for cargo loading, discharging and ballasting required by paragraph 1.2.2 shall:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.1 permit the free flow of vapour mixtures; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.2 permit the throttling of the discharge of the vapour mixtures to achieve a velocity of not less than 30 m/sec;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 be so arranged that the vapour mixture is discharged vertically upwards;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 where the method is by free flow of vapour mixtures, be such that the outlet shall be not less than 6 m above the cargo tank deck or fore and aft gangway if situated within. 4 m of the gangway and located not less than 10 m measured horizontally from the nearest air intakes and openings to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition and from deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 where the method is by high velocity discharge, be located at a height not less than 2m above the cargo tank deck and not less than 10m measured horizontally from the nearest air intakes and openings to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition and from deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard. These outlets shall be provided with high velocity devices of an approved type;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 be designed on the basis of the maximum designed loading rate multiplied by a factor of at least 1.25 to take account of gas evolution, in order to prevent the pressure in any cargo tank from exceeding the design pressure. The master shall be provided with information regarding the maximum permissible loading rate for each cargo tank and in the case of combined venting systems, for each group of cargo tanks.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.10 In combination carriers, the arrangement to isolate slop tanks containing oil or oil residues from other cargo tanks shall consist of blank flanges which will remain in position at all times when cargoes other than liquid cargoes referred to in Regulation 55.1 are carried.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Cargo tank purging and/or gas freeing</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Arrangements for purging and/or gas freeing shall be such as to minimize the hazards due to the dispersal of flammable vapours in the atmosphere and to flammable mixtures in a cargo tank. Accordingly:</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 When the ship is provided with an inert gas system the cargo tanks shall first be purged in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 62.13 until the concentration of hydrocarbon vapours in the cargo tanks has been reduced to less than 2 percent by volume. Thereafter, venting may be at the cargo tank deck level.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 When the ship is not provided with an inert gas system, the operation shall be such that the flammable vapour is initially discharged:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.1 through the vent outlets as specified in paragraph 1.9; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.2 with a vertical exit velocity of at least 20 m/sec through outlets at least 2 m above the cargo tank deck level and which are protected by suitable devices to prevent the passage of flame.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>When the flammable gas concentration in the outlet has been reduced to 30 per cent of the lower flammable limit the discharge of the gas mixture may be at the cargo tank deck level.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Ventilation</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 Cargo pump rooms shall be mechanically ventilated and discharges from the exhaust fans shall be led to a safe place on the open deck. The ventilation of these rooms shall have sufficient capacity to minimize the possibility of accumulation of flammable vapours. The number of changes of air shall be at least 20 per hour, based upon the gross volume of the space. The air ducts shall be arranged so that all of the space is effectively ventilated. The ventilation shall be of the suction type using fans of the non-sparking type.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 The arrangement of ventilation inlets and outlets and other deckhouse and superstructure boundary space openings shall be such as to complement the provisions of paragraph 1. Such vents especially for machinery spaces shall be situated as far aft as practicable. Due consideration in this regard should be given when the ship is equipped to load or discharge at the stern. Sources of ignition such as electrical equipment shall be so arranged as to avoid an explosion hazard.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.3 In combination carriers all cargo spaces and any enclosed spaces adjacent to cargo spaces shall be capable of being mechanically ventilated. The mechanical ventilation may be provided by portable fans. An approved fixed gas warning system capable of monitoring flammable vapours shall be provided in cargo pump rooms and pipe ducts and cofferdams referred to in Regulation 56.1 adjacent to slop tanks. Suitable arrangements shall be made to facilitate measurement of flammable vapours in all other spaces within the cargo tank area. Such measurements shall be made possible from open deck or easily accessible positions.</H5></BODY></HTML>
