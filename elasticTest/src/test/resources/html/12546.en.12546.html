<H3 class=regulation align=center>Location and separation of spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Machinery spaces of category A other than such spaces for bow thrusters and their associated equipment shall be positioned aft of cargo tanks and slop tanks; they shall also be situated aft of cargo pump rooms and cofferdams, but not necessarily aft of the oil fuel bunker tanks. Any machinery space of category A shall be isolated from cargo tanks and slop tanks by a cofferdam, a cargo pump room, or an oil fuel bunker tank. However, the lower portion of the pump room may be recessed into machinery spaces of category A to accommodate pumps provided that the deckhead of the recess is in general not more than one third of the moulded depth above the keel except that in the case of ships of not more than 25,000 tonnes deadweight, where it can be demonstrated that for reasons of access and satisfactory piping arrangements this is impracticable, the Administration may permit a recess in excess of such height, but not exceeding one half of the moulded depth above the keel.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Accommodation spaces, main cargo control stations, control stations and service spaces (excluding isolated cargo handling gear lockers) shall be positioned aft of all cargo tanks, slop tanks, cargo pump rooms and cofferdams which isolate cargo or slop tanks from machinery spaces of category A. Any common bulkheads separating a cargo pump room, including the cargo pump room entrance, from accommodation and service spaces and control stations shall be constructed to "A-60" standard. Where deemed necessary, accommodation spaces, control stations, machinery spaces other than those of category A, and service spaces may be permitted forward of all cargo tanks, slop tanks, cargo pump rooms and cofferdams subject to an equivalent standard of safety and appropriate availability of fire-extinguishing arrangements being provided to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Where the fitting of a navigation position above the cargo tank area is shown to be necessary it shall be for navigation purposes only and it shall be separated from the cargo tank deck by means of an open space with a height of at least 2 m. The fire protection of such navigation position shall in addition be as required for control spaces as set forth in Regulation 58.1 and 58.2 and other provisions, as applicable, of this Part.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Means shall be provided to keep deck spills away from the accommodation and service areas. This may be accomplished by provision of a permanent continuous coaming of a suitable height extending from side to side. Special consideration shall be given to the arrangements associated with stern loading.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Exterior boundaries of superstructures and deckhouses enclosing accommodation and service spaces and including any overhanging decks which support such accommodation, shall be insulated to "A-60" standard for the whole of the portions which face cargo oil tanks and for 3 m aft of the front boundary. In the case of the sides of these superstructures and deckhouses, such insulation shall be carried as high as is deemed necessary by the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.1 Entrances, air inlets and openings to accommodation spaces, service spaces and control stations shall not face the cargo area. They shall be located on the end bulkhead not facing the cargo area and/or on the outboard side of the superstructure or deckhouse at a distance of at least 25 percent of the length of the ship but not less than 3 m from the end of the superstructure or deckhouse facing the cargo area. This distance, however, need not exceed 5 m.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.2 No doors shall be permitted within the limits mentioned in paragraph 6.1, except that doors to those spaces not having access to accommodation spaces, service spaces and control stations, such as cargo control stations, provision rooms and store-rooms may be permitted by the Administration. Where such doors are fitted, the boundaries of the space shall be insulated to "A-60" standard. Bolted plates for removal of machinery may be fitted within the limits specified in paragraph 6.1. Navigating bridge doors and wheelhouse windows may be located within the limits specified in paragraph 6.1 so long as they are so designed that a rapid and efficient gas and vapour tightening of the navigating bridge can be ensured.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.3 Port lights facing the cargo area and on the sides of the superstructures and deckhouses within the limits specified in paragraph 6.1 shall be of the fixed (non-opening) type. Such port lights in the first tier on the main deck shall be fitted with inside covers of steel or other equivalent material.</H4></BODY></HTML>
