<h3 class="regulation" align="center">Construction and initial tests of watertight decks, trunks, etc., in passenger ships and cargo ships</h3>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">1 Watertight decks, trunks, tunnels, duct keels and ventilators shall be of the same strength as watertight bulkheads at corresponding levels. The means used for making them watertight, and the arrangements adopted for closing openings in them, shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration. Watertight ventilators and trunks shall be carried at least up to the bulkhead deck in passenger ships and up to the freeboard deck in cargo ships.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">2 Where a ventilation trunk passing through a structure penetrates the bulkhead deck, the trunk shall be capable of withstanding the water pressure that may be present within the trunk, after having taken into account the maximum heel angle allowable during intermediate stage of flooding, in accordance with regulation 8.5.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">3 Where all or part of the penetration of the bulkhead deck is on the main ro-ro deck, the trunk shall be capable of withstanding impact pressure due to internal water motions (sloshing) of water trapped on the ro-ro deck.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">4 In ships constructed before 1 July 1997, the requirements of paragraph 2 shall apply not later than the date of the first periodical survey after 1 July 1997.</h4>
<h4 class="subtitle" align="left">5 After completion, a hose or flooding test shall be applied to watertight decks and a hose test to watertight trunks, tunnels and ventilators.</h4></body>
