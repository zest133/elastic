<H4 class=subtitle>7.1 Each power-operated sliding watertight door:</H4>
<H5 class=body1>.1 shall have a vertical or horizontal motion.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>.2 shall, subject to paragraph 11, be normally limited to a maximum clear opening width of 1.2 m. The Administration may permit larger doors only to the extent considered necessary for the effective operation of the ship provided that other safety measures, including the following, are taken into consideration:</H5>
<H6 class=body2>.2.1 special consideration shall be given to the strength of the door and its closing appliances in order to prevent leakages;</H6>
<H6 class=body2>.2.2 the door shall be located outside the damage zone B 5 ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2>.2.3 the door shall be kept closed when the ship is at sea, except for limited periods when absolutely necessary as determined by the Administration;</H6>
<H5 class=body1>.3 shall be fitted with the necessary equipment to open and close the door using electric power, hydraulic power, or any other form of power that is acceptable to the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>.4 shall be provided with an individual hand-operated mechanism. It shall be possible to open and close the door by hand at the door itself from either side, and in addition, close the door from an accessible position above the bulkhead deck with an all round crank motion or some other movement providing the same degree of safety acceptable to their Administration. Direction of rotation of other movement is to be clearly indicated at all operating positions, The time necessary for the complete closure of the door, when operating by hand gear, shall not exceed 90s with the ship in the upright position;</H5>
<H5 class=body1>.5 shall be provided with controls for opening and closing the door by power from both sides of the door and also for closing the door by power from the central operating console at the navigating bridge;</H5>
<H5 class=body1>.6 shall be provided an audible alarm, distinct from any other alarm in the area, which will sound whenever the door is closed remotely by power and which shall sound for at least 5s but no more than 10s before the door begins to move and shall continue sounding until the door is completely closed. In the case of remote hand operation it is sufficient for the audible alarm to sound only when the door is moving. Additionally, in passenger areas and areas of high ambient noise the Administration may require the audible alarm to be supplemented by an intermittent visual signal at the door ; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1>.7 shall have an approximately uniform rate of closure under power. The closure time, from the time the door begins to move to the time it reaches the completely closed position, shall in no case be less than 20s or more than 40s with the ship in the upright position.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>7.2 The electrical power required for power-operated sliding watertight doors shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck. The associated control, indication and alarm circuits shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck and be capable of being automatically supplied by the transitional source of emergency electrical power required by regulation 42.3.1.3 in the event of failure of either the main or emergency source of electrical power.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>7.3 Power-operated sliding watertight doors shall have either:</H4>
<H5 class=body1>.1 a centralized hydraulic system with two independent power sources each consisting of a motor and pump capable of simultaneously closing all doors. In addition, there shall be for the whole installation hydraulic accumulators of sufficient capacity to operate all the doors at least three times, i.e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15°. This operating cycle shall be capable of being carried out when the accumulator is at the pump cut-in pressure. The fluid used shall be chosen considering the temperatures liable to be encountered by the installation during its service. The power operating system shall be designed to minimize the possibility of having a single failure in the hydraulic piping adversely affect the operation of more than one door. The hydraulic system shall be provided with a low-level alarm for hydraulic fluid reservoirs serving the power-operated system and a low gas pressure alarm or other effective means of monitoring loss of stored energy in hydraulic accumulators. These alarms are to be audible and visual and shall be situated on the central operating console at the navigating bridge ; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1>.2 an independent hydraulic system for each door with each power source consisting of a motor and pump capable of opening and closing the door. In addition, there shall be a hydraulic accumulator of sufficient capacity to operate the door at least three times, i.e closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15°. This operating cycle shall be capable of being carried out when the accumulator is at the pump cut-in pressure. The fluid used shall be chosen considering the temperatures liable to be encountered by the installation during its service. A low gas pressure group alarm or other effective means of monitoring loss of stored energy in hydraulic accumulators shall be provided at the central operating console on the navigating bridge. Loss of stored energy indication at each local operating position shall also be provided ; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1>.3 an independent electrical system and motor for each door with each power source consisting of a motor capable of opening and closing the door. The power source shall be capable of being automatically supplied by the transitional source of emergency electrical power as required by regulation 42.4.2-in the event of failure of either the main or emergency source of electrical power and with sufficient capacity to operate the door at least three times, i.e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15°. </H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>For the systems specified in 7.3.1, 7.3.2 and 7.3.3, provision should be made as follows: </H4>
<H5 class=body1>Power systems for power-operated watertight sliding doors shall be separated from any other power system. A single failure in the electric or hydraulic power-operated systems excluding the hydraulic actuator shall not prevent the hand operation of any door.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>7.4 Control handles shall be provided at each side of the bulkhead at a minimum height of 1.6m above the floor and shall be so arranged as to enable persons passing through the doorway to hold both handles in the open position without being able to set the power closing mechanism in operation accidently. The direction of movement of the handles in opening and closing the door shall be in the direction of door movement and shall be clearly indicated.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>7.5 As far as practicable, electrical equipment and components for watertight doors shall be situated above the bulkhead deck and outside hazardous areas and spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>7.6 The enclosures of electrical components necessarily situated below the bulkhead deck shall provides suitable protection against the ingress of water.*</H4>
<H6 class=footnote>* Refer to the following IEC publication 60529(1989), as amended by its amendment 1 (1999): </H6>
<H6 class=footnote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .1 electrical motors, associated circuits and control components; protected to IPX7 standard; </H6>
<H6 class=footnote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .2 door position indicators and associated circuit components; protected to IPX8 standard; and </H6>
<H6 class=footnote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .3 door movement warning signals; protected to IPX6 standard. </H6>
<H6 class=footnote>Other arrangements for the enclosures of electrical components may be fitted provided the Administration is satisfied that an equivalent protection is achieved. The water pressure testing of the enclosures protected to IPX8 shall be based on the pressure that may occur at the location of the component during flooding for a period of 36 h. </H6>
<H4 class=subtitle>7.7 Electric power, control, indication and alarm circuits shall be protected against fault in such a way that a failure in one door circuit will not cause a failure in any other door circuit. Short circuits or other faults in the alarm or indicator circuits of a door shall not result in a loss of power operation of that door. Arrangements shall be such that leakage of water into the electrical equipment located below the bulkhead deck will not cause the door to open.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>7.8 A single electrical failure in the power operating or control system of a power-operated sliding watertight door shall not result in a closed door opening. Availability of the power supply should be continuously monitored at a point in the electrical circuit as near as practicable to each of the motors required by paragraph 7.3. Loss of any such power supply should activate an audible and visual alarm at the central operating console at the navigating bridge.</H4></BODY></HTML>
