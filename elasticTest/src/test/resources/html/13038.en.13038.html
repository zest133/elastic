<H3 class=regulation align=center>Self-righting partially enclosed lifeboats</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Self-righting partially enclosed lifeboats shall comply with the requirements of regulation 41 and in addition shall comply with the requirements of this regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Enclosure</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 Permanently attached rigid covers shall be provided extending over not less than 20% of the length of the lifeboat from the stem and not less than 20 per cent of the length of the lifeboat from the aftermost part of the lifeboat.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 The rigid covers shall form two shelters. If the shelters have bulkheads they shall have openings of sufficient size to permit easy access by persons each wearing an immersion suit or warm clothes and a lifejacket. The interior height of the shelters shall be sufficient to permit persons easy access to their seats in the bow and stern of the lifeboat.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3 The rigid covers shall be so arranged that they include window or translucent panels to admit sufficient daylight to the inside of the lifeboat with the openings or canopies closed so as to make artificial light unnecessary.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.4 The rigid covers shall have railings to provide a secure handhold for persons moving about the exterior of the lifeboat.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.5 Open parts of the lifeboat shall be fitted with a permanently attached foldable canopy so arranged that:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 it can be easily erected by not more than two persons in not more than 2 min;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 it is insulated to protect the occupants against cold by means of not less than two layers of material separated by an air gap or other equally efficient means.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.6 The enclosure formed by the rigid covers and canopy shall be so arranged:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 as to allow launching and recovery operations to be performed without any occupant having to leave the enclosure;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 that it has entrances at both ends and on each side, provided with efficient adjustable closing arrangements which can be easily and quickly opened and closed from inside or outside so as to permit ventilation but exclude seawater, wind and cold; means shall be provided for holding the entrances securely in the open and in the closed position;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 that with the canopy erected and all entrances closed, sufficient air is admitted for the occupants at all times;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 that it has means for collecting rainwater;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 that the exterior of the rigid covers and canopy and the interior of that part of the lifeboat covered by the canopy is of a highly visible colour. The interior of the shelters shall be of a colour which does not cause discomfort to the occupants;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6 that it is possible to row the lifeboat.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Capsizing and re-righting</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 A safety belt shall be fitted at each indicated seating position. The safety belt shall be so designed as to hold a person of a mass of 100 kg securely in place when the lifeboat is in a capsized position.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 The stability of the lifeboat shall be such that it is inherently or automatically self-righting when loaded with its full or a partial complement of persons and equipment and the persons are secured with safety belts.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Propulsion</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 The engine and transmission shall be controlled from the helmsman's position.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 The engine and engine installation shall be capable of running in any position during capsize and continue to run after the lifeboat returns to the upright or shall automatically stop on capsizing and be easily restarted after the lifeboat returns to the upright and the water has been drained from the lifeboat. The design of the fuel and lubricating systems shall prevent the loss of fuel and the loss of more than 250 ml of lubricating oil from the engine during capsize.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.3 Air-cooled engines shall have a duct system to take in cooling air from, and exhaust it to, the outside of the lifeboat. Manually operated dampers shall be provided to enable cooling air to be taken in from, and exhausted to, the interior of the lifeboat.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Construction and fendering</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.1 Notwithstanding regulation 41.1.6, a self-righting partially enclosed lifeboat shall be so constructed and fendered as to ensure that the lifeboat renders protection against harmful accelerations resulting from an impact of the lifeboat, when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment, against the ship's side at an impact velocity of not less than 3.5 m/s.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.2 The lifeboat shall be automatically self-bailing.</H5></BODY></HTML>
