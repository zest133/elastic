<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 a cargo ship, whenever built, which is converted to a passenger ship shall be treated as a passenger ship constructed on the date on which such a conversion commences.</H5>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 The Administration of a State may, if it considers that the sheltered nature and conditions of the voyage are such as to render the application of any specific requirements of this Chapter unreasonable or unnecessary, exempt from those requirements individual ships or classes of ships entitled to fly the flag of that State which, in the course of their voyage, do not proceed more than 20 miles from the nearest land.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Any passenger ship which is permitted under Regulation III/27(c) to carry a number of persons in excess of the lifeboat capacity provided, shall comply with the special standards of subdivision set out in Regulation 6.5, and the associated special provisions regarding permeability in Regulation 5.4, unless the Administration is satisfied that, having regard to the nature and conditions of the voyage, compliance with the other provisions of the Regulations of this Chapter and Chapter II-2 is sufficient.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 In the case of passenger ships which are employed in special trades for the carriage of large numbers of special trade passengers, such as the pilgrim trade, the Administration of the State whose flag such ships are entitled to fly, if satisfied that it is impracticable to enforce compliance with the requirements of this Chapter, may exempt such ships from those requirements, provided that they comply fully with the provisions of:</H4>
