<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 16</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Ventilation systems in ships other than passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Ventilation ducts shall be of non-combustible material. Short ducts however, not generally exceeding 2 m in length and with a cross-section not exceeding 0.02 m<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;need not be non-combustible, subject to the following conditions;</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 these ducts shall be of a material which has low flame spread characteristics.;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 they may only be used at the end of the ventilation device;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 they shall not be situated less than 600 mm, measured along the duct, from an opening in an "A" or "B" class division including continuous "B" class ceilings.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Where the ventilation ducts with a free-sectional area exceeding 0.02 m<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;pass through class "A" bulkheads or decks, the opening shall be lined with a steel sheet sleeve unless the ducts passing through the bulkheads or decks are of steel in the vicinity of passage through the deck or bulkhead and the ducts and sleeves shall comply in this part with the following:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 The sleeves shall have a thickness of at least 3 mm and a length of at least 900 mm. When passing through bulkheads, this length shall be divided preferably into 450 mm on each side of the bulkhead. These ducts, or sleeves lining such ducts, shall be provided with fire insulation. The insulation shall have at least the same fire integrity as the bulkhead or deck through which the duct passes. Equivalent penetration protection may be provided to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 Ducts with a free cross-sectional area exceeding 0.075 m<SUP>2 </SUP>shall be fitted with fire dampers in addition to the requirements of paragraph 2.1. The fire damper shall operate automatically but shall also be capable of being closed manually from both sides of the bulkhead or deck. The damper shall be provided with an indicator which shows whether the damper is open or closed. Fire dampers are not required, however, where ducts pass through spaces surrounded by "A" class divisions, without serving those spaces, provided those ducts have the same fire integrity as the divisions which they pierce.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Ducts provided for the ventilation of machinery spaces of category A, galleys, car deck spaces, ro/ro cargo spaces or special category spaces shall not pass through accommodation spaces, service spaces or control stations unless the ducts are either:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1.1 constructed of steel having a thickness of at least 3 mm and 5 mm for ducts the widths of diameters of which are up to and including 300 mm and 760 mm and over respectively and, in the case of such ducts, the widths or diameters of which are between 300 mm and 760 mm having a thickness to be obtained by interpolation;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1.2 suitably supported and stiffened;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1.3 fitted with automatic fire dampers close to the boundaries penetrated; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1.4 insulated to "A-60" standard from the machinery spaces, galleys, car deck space, ro/ro cargo spaces or special category spaces to a point at least 5 m beyond each fire damper;</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>or</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2.1 constructed of steel in accordance with paragraphs 3.1.1 and 3.1.2; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2.2 insulated to "A-60" standard throughout the accommodation spaces, service spaces or control stations;</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>except that penetrations of main zone divisions shall also comply with the requirements of paragraph 8.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Ducts provided for ventilation to accommodation spaces, service spaces or control stations shall not pass through machinery spaces of category A, galleys, car deck spaces, ro/ro cargo spaces or special category spaces unless either:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1.1 the ducts where they pass through a machinery space of category A, galley, car deck space, ro/ro cargo space or special category space are constructed of steel in accordance with paragraphs 3.1.1 and 3.1.2;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1.2 automatic fire dampers are fitted close to the boundaries penetrated;and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1.3 the integrity of the machinery space, galley, car deck space, ro/ro cargo space or special category space boundaries in maintained at the penetrations;</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>or</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2.1 the ducts where they pass through a machinery space of category A, galley, car deck space, ro/ro cargo space or special category space are constructed of steel in accordance with paragraphs 3.1.1 and 3.1.2; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2.2 are insulated to "A-60" standard within the machinery space, galley, car deck space, ro/ro cargo space or special category space;</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Except that penetrations of main zone divisions shall also comply with the requirements of paragraph 8.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Ventilation ducts with a free cross-sectional area exceeding 0.02m<SUP>2</SUP> passing through "B" class bulkheads shall be lined with steel sheet sleeves of 900 mm in length divided preferably into 450 mm on each side of the bulkheads unless the duct is of steel for this length.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Such measures as are practicable shall be taken in respect of control stations outside machinery spaces in order to ensure that ventilation, visibility and freedom from smoke are maintained, so that in the event of fire the machinery and equipment contained therein may be supervised and continue to function effectively. Alternative and separate means of air supply shall be provided;air inlets of the two sources of supply shall be so disposed that the risk of both inlets drawing in smoke simultaneously is minimized. At the discretion of the Administration, such requirements need not apply to control stations situated on, and opening on to, an open deck, or where local closing arrangements would be equally effective.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Where they pass through accommodation spaces or spaces containing combustible materials, the exhaust ducts from galley ranges shall be constructed of "A" class divisions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Each exhaust duct shall be fitted with:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 a grease trap readily removable for cleaning;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 a fire damper located in the lower end of the duct;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 arrangements, operable from within the galley, for shutting off the exhaust fans; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 fixed means for extinguishing a fire within the duct.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 Where in a passenger ship it is necessary that a ventilation duct passes through a main vertical zone division, a fail-safe automatic closing fire damper shall be fitted adjacent to the division. The damper shall also be capable of being manually closed from each side of the division. The operating position shall be readily accessible and be marked in red light-reflecting colour. The duct between the division and the damper shall be of steel or other equivalent material and, if necessary, insulated to comply with the requirements of Regulation 18.1.1. The damper shall be fitted on at least one side of the division with a visible indicator showing whether the damper is in the open position.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9 The main inlets and outlets of all ventilation systems shall be capable of being closed from outside the spaces being ventilated.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10 Power ventilation of accommodation spaces, service spaces, cargo spaces, control stations and machinery spaces shall be capable of being stopped from an easily accessible position outside the space being served. This position should not be readily cut off in the event of a fire in the spaces served. The means provided for stopping the power ventilation of the machinery spaces shall be entirely separate from the means provided for stopping ventilation of other spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11 The following arrangements shall be tested in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 fire dampers, including relevant means of operation;and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 duct penetrations through "A" class divisions. Where steel sleeves are directly joined to ventilation ducts by means of rivetted or screwed flanges or by welding, the test is not required.</H5></BODY></HTML>
