<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The freeboard corresponding to each of these load lines shall be measured at the same position and from the same deck line as the freeboards determined in accordance with the International Convention respecting Load Lines in force.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The freeboard corresponding to each approved subdivision load line and the conditions of service for which it is approved, shall be clearly indicated on the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) In no case shall any subdivision load line mark be placed above the deepest load line in salt water as determined by the strength of the ship and/or the International Convention respecting Load Lines in force.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) Whatever may be the position of the subdivision load line marks, a ship shall in no case be loaded so as to submerge the load line mark appropriate to the season and locality as determined in accordance with the International Convention respecting Load Lines in force.</H4>
