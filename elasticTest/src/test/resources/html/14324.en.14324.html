<H3 class=regulation align=center>Watertight integrity of passenger ships above the margin line</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The Administration may require that all reasonable and practicable measures shall be taken to limit the entry and spread of water above the bulkhead deck. Such measures may include partial bulkheads or webs. When partial watertight bulkheads and webs are fitted on the bulkhead deck, above or in the immediate vicinity of main subdivision bulkheads, they shall have watertight shell and bulkhead deck connections so as to restrict the flow of water along the deck when the ship is in a heeled damaged condition. Where the partial watertight bulkhead does not line up with the bulkhead below, the bulkhead deck between shall be made effectively watertight.*</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12543&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ. 541</A>(as may be amended): Guidance notes on the integrity of flooding boundaries above the bulkhead deck of passenger ships for proper application of regulations II-1/8 and 20, paragraph 1, of SOLAS 1974, as amended.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The bulkhead deck or a deck above it shall be weathertight. All openings in the exposed weather deck shall have coamings of ample height and strength and shall be provided with efficient means for expeditiously closing them weathertight. Freeing ports, open rails and scuppers shall be fitted as necessary for rapidly clearing the weather deck of water under all weather conditions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 In passenger ships constructed on or after 1 July 1997, the open end of air pipes terminating within a superstructure shall be at least 1 m above the waterline when the ship heels to an angle of 15, or the maximum angle of heel during intermediate stages of flooding, as determined by direct calculation, whichever is the greater. Alternatively, air pipes from tanks other than oil tanks may discharge through the side of the superstructure. The provisions of this paragraph are without prejudice to the provisions of the International Convention on Load Lines in force.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Sidescuttles, gangway, cargo and coaling ports and other means for closing openings in the shell plating above the margin line shall be of efficient design and construction and of sufficient strength having regard to the spaces in which they are fitted and their positions relative to the deepest subdivision load line.*</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Recommendation on strength and security and locking arrangements of shell doors on ro-ro passenger ships adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7271&amp;localekey=en">A.793(19)</A></H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Efficient inside deadlights, so arranged that they can be easily and effectively closed and secured watertight, shall be provided for all sidescuttles to spaces below the first deck above the bulkhead deck.</H4></BODY></HTML>
