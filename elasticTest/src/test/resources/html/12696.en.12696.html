<H3 class=regulation align=center>Inert gas systems</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The inert gas system referred to in Regulation 60 shall be designed, constructed and tested to the satisfaction of the Administration. It shall be so designed and operated as to render and maintain the atmosphere of the cargo tanks* non-flammable at all times, except when such tanks are required to be gas free. In the event that the inert gas system is unable to meet the operational requirement set out above and it has been assessed that it is impractical to effect a repair, then cargo discharge, deballasting and necessary tank cleaning shall only be resumed when the "emergency conditions" laid down in the Guidelines on Inert Gas Systems** are complied with.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Throughout this Regulation the term "cargo tank" includes also "slop tanks".</H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>** Reference is made to Revised Guidelines for Inert Gas Systems, adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee at its forty-second session in May 1980(MSC/Circ.282).</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The system shall be capable of:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 inerting empty cargo tanks by reducing the oxygen content of the atmosphere in each tank to a level at which combustion cannot be supported;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 maintaining the atmosphere in any part of any cargo tank with an oxygen content not exceeding 8 per cent by volume and at a positive pressure at all times in port and at sea except when it is necessary for such a tank to be gas free;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 eliminating the need for air to enter a tank during normal operations except when it is necessary for such a tank to be gas free;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 purging empty cargo tanks of hydrocarbon gas, so that subsequent gas freeing operations will at no time create a flammable atmosphere within the tank.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.1 The system shall be capable of delivering inert gas to the cargo tanks at a rate of at least 125 per cent of the maximum rate of discharge capacity of the ship expressed as a volume.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.2 The system shall be capable of delivering inert gas with an oxygen content of not more than 5 per cent by volume in the inert gas supply main to the cargo tanks at any required rate of flow</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 The inert gas supply may be treated flue gas from main or auxiliary boilers. The Administration may accept systems using flue gases from one or more separate gas generators or other sources or any combination thereof, provided that an equivalent standard of safety is achieved. Such systems should, as far as practicable, comply with the requirements of this Regulation. Systems using stored carbon dioxide shall not be permitted unless the Administration is satisfied that the risk of ignition from generation of static electricity by the system itself is minimized.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Flue gas isolating valves shall be fitted in the inert gas supply mains between the boiler uptakes and the flue gas scrubber. These valves shall be provided with indicators to show whether they are open or shut, and precautions shall be taken to maintain them gastight and keep the seatings clear of soot. Arrangements shall be made to ensure that boiler soot blowers cannot be operated when the corresponding flue gas valve is open.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.1 A flue gas scrubber shall be fitted which will effectively cool the volume of gas specified in paragraph 3 and remove solids and sulphur combustion products. The cooling water arrangements shall be such that an adequate supply of water will always be available without interfering with any essential services on the ship. Provision shall also be made for an alternative supply of cooling water.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.2 Filters or equivalent devices shall be fitted to minimize the amount of water carried over to the inert gas blowers.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.3 The scrubber shall be located aft of all cargo tanks, cargo pump rooms and cofferdams separating these spaces from machinery spaces of category A.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7.1 At least two blowers shall be fitted which together shall be capable of delivering to the cargo tanks at least the volume of gas required by paragraph 3. In the system with gas generator the Administration may permit only one blower if that system is capable of delivering the total volume of gas required by paragraph 3 to the protected cargo tanks, provided that sufficient spares for the blower and its prime mover are carried on board to enable any failure of the blower and its prime mover to be rectified by the ship's crew.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7.2 Two fuel oil pumps shall be fitted to the inert gas generator. The Administration may permit only one fuel oil pump on condition that sufficient spares for the fuel oil pump and its prime mover are carried on board to enable any failure of the fuel oil pump and its prime mover to be rectified by the ship's crew.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7.3 The inert gas system shall be so designed that the maximum pressure which it can exert on any cargo tank will not exceed the test pressure of any cargo tank. Suitable shut-off arrangements shall be provided on the suction and discharge connections of each blower. Arrangements shall be provided to enable the functioning of the inert gas plant to be stabilized before commencing cargo discharge. If the blowers are to be used for gas freeing, their air inlets shall be provided with blanking arrangements.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7.4 The blowers shall be located aft of all cargo tanks, cargo pump rooms and cofferdams separating these spaces from machinery spaces of category A.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8.1 Special consideration shall be given to the design and location of scrubber and blowers with relevant piping and fittings in order to prevent flue gas leakages into enclosed spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8.2 To permit safe maintenance, an additional water seal or other effective means of preventing flue gas leakage shall be fitted between the flue gas isolating valves and scrubber or incorporated in the gas entry to the scrubber.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.1 A gas regulating valve shall be fitted in the inert gas supply main. This valve shall be automatically controlled to close as required in paragraphs 19.3 and 19.4. It shall also be capable of automatically regulating the flow of inert gas to the cargo tanks unless means are provided to automatically control the speed of the inert gas blowers required in paragraph 7.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.2 The valve referred to in paragraph 9.1 shall be located at the forward bulkhead of the forwardmost gas safe space* through which the inert gas supply main passes.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Gas safe space is a space in which the entry of hydrocarbon gases would produce hazards with regard to flammability or toxicity.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.1 At least two non-return devices, one of which shall be a water seal, shall be fitted in the inert gas supply main, in order to prevent the return of hydrocarbon vapour to the machinery space uptakes or to any gas safe spaces under all normal conditions of trim, list and motion of the ship. They shall be located between the automatic valve required by paragraph 9.1 and the aftermost connection to any cargo tank or cargo pipeline.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.2 The devices referred to in paragraph 10.1 shall be located in the cargo area on deck.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.3 The water seal referred to in paragraph 10.1 shall be capable of being supplied by two separate pumps, each of which shall be capable of maintaining an adequate supply at all times.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.4 The arrangement of the seal and its associated fittings shall be such that it will prevent backflow of hydrocarbon vapours and will ensure the proper functioning of the seal under operating conditions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.5 Provision shall be made to ensure that the water seal is protected against freezing, in such a way that the integrity of seal is not impaired by overheating.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.6 A water loop or other approved arrangement shall also be fitted to each associated water supply and drain pipe and each venting or pressure-sensing pipe leading to gas safe spaces. Means shall be provided to prevent such loops from being emptied by vacuum.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.7 The deck water seal and all loop arrangements shall be capable of preventing return of hydrocarbon vapours at a pressure equal to the test pressure of the cargo tanks.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.8 The second device shall be a non-return valve or equivalent capable of preventing the return of vapours or liquids and fitted forward of the deck water seal required in paragraph 10.1. It shall be provided with positive means of closure. As an alternative to positive means of closure, an additional valve having such means of closure may be provided forward of the non-return valve to isolate the deck water seal from the inert gas main to the cargo tanks.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.9 As an additional safeguard against the possible leakage of hydrocarbon liquids or vapours back from the deck main, means shall be provided to permit this section of the line between the valve having positive means of closure referred to in paragraph 10.8 and the valve referred to in paragraph 9 to be vented in a safe manner when the first of these valves is closed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11.1 The inert gas main may be divided into two or more branches forward of the non-return devices required by paragraph 10.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11.2.1 The inert gas supply mains shall be fitted with branch piping leading to each cargo tank. Branch piping for inert gas shall be fitted with either stop valves or equivalent means of control for isolating each tank. Where stop valves are fitted, they shall be provided with locking arrangements, which shall be under the control of a responsible ship's officer.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11.2.2 In combination carriers, the arrangement to isolate the slop tanks containing oil or oil residues from other tanks shall consist of blank flanges which will remain in position at all times when cargoes other than oil are being carried except as provided for in the relevant section of the Guidelines on Inert Gas Systems.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11.3 Means shall be provided to protect cargo tanks against the effect of overpressure or vacuum caused by thermal variations when the cargo tanks are isolated from the inert gas mains.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11.4 Piping systems shall be so designed as to prevent the accumulation of cargo or water in the pipelines under all normal conditions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11.5 Suitable arrangements shall be provided to enable the inert gas main to be connected to an external supply of inert gas.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>12 The arrangements for the venting of all vapours displaced from the cargo tanks during loading and ballasting shall comply with Regulation 59.1 and shall consist of either one or more mast risers, or a number of high velocity vents. The inert gas supply mains may be used for such venting.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>13 The arrangements for inerting, purging or gas freeing of empty tanks as required in paragraph 2 shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration and shall be such that the accumulation of hydrocarbon vapours in pockets formed by the internal structural members in a tank is minimized and that:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 on individual cargo tanks the gas outlet pipe, if fitted, shall be positioned as far as practicable from the inert gas/air inlet and in accordance with Regulation 59.1. The inlet of such outlet pipes may be located either at deck level or at not more than 1 m above the bottom of the tank;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 the cross sectional area of such gas outlet pipe referred to in paragraph 13.1 shall be such that an exit velocity of at least 20 m/sec can be maintained when any three tanks are being simultaneously supplied with inert gas. Their outlets shall extend not less than 2 m above deck level;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 each gas outlet referred to in paragraph 13.2 shall be fitted with suitable blanking arrangements;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4.1 if a connection is fitted between the inert gas supply mains and the cargo piping system, arrangements shall be made to ensure an effective isolation having regard to the large pressure difference which may exist between the systems. This shall consist of two shut-off valves with an arrangement to vent the space between the valves in a safe manner or an arrangement consisting of a spool-piece with associated blanks;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4.2 the valve separating the inert gas supply main from the cargo main and which is on the cargo main side shall be a non-return valve with a positive means of closure.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>14.1 One or more pressure vacuum breaking devices shall be provided to prevent the cargo tanks from being subject to:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 a positive pressure in excess of the test pressure of the cargo tank if the cargo were to be loaded at the maximum rated capacity and all other outlets are left shut;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 a negative pressure in excess of 700mm water gauge if cargo were to be discharged at the maximum rated capacity of the cargo pumps and the inert gas blowers were to fail. Such devices shall be installed on the inert gas main unless they are installed in the venting system required by Regulation 59.1.1 or on individual cargo tanks.</H5>
