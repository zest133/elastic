<H3 class=regulation align=center>Requirements for Inflatable Liferafts</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Every inflatable liferaft shall be so constructed that, when fully inflated and floating with the cover uppermost, it shall be stable in a seaway.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The liferaft shall be so constructed that if it is dropped into the water from a height of 18 metres (60 feet) neither the liferaft nor its equipment will be damaged. If the raft is to be stowed on the ship at a height above the water of more than 18 metres (60 feet), it shall be of a type which has been satisfactorily drop-tested from a height at least equal to the height at which it is to be stowed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The construction of the liferaft shall include a cover which shall automatically be set in place when the liferaft is inflated. This cover shall be capable of protecting the occupants against injury from exposure, and means shall be provided for collecting rain. The top of the cover shall be fitted with a lamp which derives its luminosity from a sea-activated cell and a similar lamp shall also be fitted inside the liferaft. The cover of the liferaft shall be of a highly visible colour.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The liferaft shall be fitted with a painter and shall have a line securely becketed round the outside. A lifeline shall also be fitted around the inside of the liferaft.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) The liferaft shall be capable of being readily righted by one person if it inflates in an inverted position.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) The liferaft shall be fitted at each opening with efficient means to enable persons in the water to climb on board.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) The liferaft shall be contained in a valise or other container so constructed as to be capable of withstanding hard wear under conditions met with at sea. The liferaft in its valise or other container shall be inherently buoyant.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) The buoyancy of the liferaft shall be so arranged as to ensure by a division into an even number of separate compartments, half of which shall be capable of supporting out of the water the number of persons which the liferaft is permitted to accommodate, or by some other equally efficient means, that there is a reasonable margin of buoyancy if the raft is damaged or partially fails to inflate.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(i) The total weight of the liferaft, its valise or other container and its equipment shall not exceed 180 kilograms (400 lbs.).</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(j) The number of persons which an inflatable liferaft shall be permitted to accommodate shall be equal to :</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) the greatest whole number obtained by dividing by 96 the volume, measured in cubic decimeters (or by 3.4 the volume, measured in cubic feet) of the main buoyancy tubes (which for this purpose shall include neither the arches nor the thwart or thwarts if fitted) when inflated; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) the greatest whole number obtained by dividing by 3,720 the area measured in square centimetres (or by 4 the area, measured in square feet) of the floor (which for this purpose may include the thwart or thwarts if fitted) of the liferaft when inflated whichever number shall be the less.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(k) The floor of the liferaft shall be waterproof and shall be capable of being sufficiently insulated against cold.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(l) The liferaft shall be inflated by a gas which is not injurious to the occupants and the inflation shall take place automatically either on the pulling of a line or by some other equally simple and efficient method. Means shall be provided whereby the topping-up pump or bellows required by Regulation 17 of this Chapter may be used to maintain pressure.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(m) The liferaft shall be of approved material and construction, and shall be so constructed as to be capable of withstanding exposure for 30 days afloat in all sea conditions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(n) No liferaft shall be approved which has a carrying capacity calculated in accordance with paragraph (j) of this Regulation of less than six persons. The maximum number of persons calculated in accordance with that paragraph for which an inflatable liferaft may be approved shall be at the discretion of the Administration, but shall in no case exceed 25.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(o) The liferaft shall be capable of operating throughout a temperature range of 66°C to minus 30°C (150 degrees F to minus 22 degrees F).</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(p)</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The liferaft shall be so stowed as to be readily available in case of emergency. It shall be stowed in such a manner as to permit it to float free from its stowage, inflate and break free from the vessel in the event of sinking.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) If used, lashings shall be fitted with an automatic release system of a hydrostatic or equivalent nature approved by the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) The liferaft required by paragraph (c) of Regulation 35 of this Chapter may be securely fastened.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(q) The liferaft shall be fitted with arrangements enabling it to be readily towed.</H4></BODY></HTML>
