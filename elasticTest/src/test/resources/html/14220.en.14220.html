<H3 class=regulation align=center>Protection of stairways and lifts in accommodation and service spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 All stairways shall be of steel frame construction except where the Administration sanctions the use of other equivalent material, and shall be within enclosures formed of "A" class divisions, with positive means of closure at all openings, except that:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 a stairway connecting only two decks need not be enclosed, provided the integrity of the deck is maintained by proper bulkheads or doors in one 'tweendeck space. When a stairway is closed in one 'tweendeck space, the stairway enclosure shall be protected in accordance with the tables for decks in Regulations 26 or 27;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 stairways may be fitted in the open in a public space, provided they lie wholly within such public space.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Stairway enclosures shall have direct access with the corridors and be of a sufficient area to prevent congestion, having in view the number of persons likely to use them in an emergency. Within the perimeter of such stairway enclosures, only public toilets, lockers of non-combustible material providing storage for safety equipment and open information counters are permitted. Only public spaces, corridors, public toilets, special category spaces, other escape stairways required by 28.1.5 and external areas are permitted to have direct access to these stairway enclosures.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Lift trunks shall be so fitted as to prevent the passage of smoke and flame from one tweendeck to another and shall be provided with means of closing so as to permit the control of draught and smoke.</H4>
