<H3 class=regulation align=center>Means of escape</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Stairways and ladders shall be so arranged as to provide, from all accommodation spaces and from spaces in which the crew is normally employed, other than machinery spaces, ready means of escape to the open deck and thence to the lifeboats and liferafts. In particular the following general provisions shall be complied with:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 At all levels of accommodation there shall be provided at least two widely separated means of escape from each restricted space or group of spaces.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2.1 Below the lowest open deck the main means of escape shall be a stairway and the second escape may be a trunk or a stairway.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2.2 Above the lowest open deck the means of escape shall be stairways or doors to an open deck or a combination thereof.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 Exceptionally the Administration may dispense with one of the means of escape, due regard being paid to the nature and location of spaces and to the numbers of persons who normally might be quartered or employed there.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 No dead-end corridors having a length of more than 7 m shall be accepted. A dead-end corridor is a corridor or part of a corridor from which there is only one escape route.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 The width and continuity of the means of escape shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 If a radiotelegraph station has no direct access to the open deck, two means of access to or egress from such station shall be provided, one of which may be a porthole or window of sufficient size or other means to the satisfaction of the Administration, to provide an emergency escape.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 In all ro-ro cargo spaces where the crew is normally employed the number and locations of escape routes to the open deck shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration, but shall in no case be less than two and shall be widely separated.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Except as provided in paragraph 4, two means of escape shall be provided from each machinery space of category A. In particular, one of the following provisions shall be complied with:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 two sets of steel ladders as widely separated as possible leading to doors in the upper part of the space similarly separated and from which access is provided to the open deck. In general, one of these ladders shall provide continuous fire shelter from the lower part of the space to a safe position outside the space. However, the Administration may not require the shelter if, due to the special arrangement or dimensions of the machinery space, a safe escape route from the lower part of this space is provided. This shelter shall be of steel, insulated, where necessary, to the satisfaction of the Administration and be provided with a self-closing steel door at the lower end; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 one steel ladder leading to a door in the upper part of the space from which access is provided to the open deck and additionally, in the lower part of the space and in a position well separated from the ladder referred to, a steel door capable of being operated from each side and which provides access to a safe escape route from the lower part of the space to the open deck.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 In a ship of less than 1,000 tons gross tonnage, the Administration may dispense with one of the means of escape required under paragraph 3, due regard being paid to the dimension and disposition of the upper part of the space.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 From machinery spaces other than those of category A, escape routes shall be provided to the satisfaction of the Administration having regard to the nature and location of the space and whether persons are normally employed in that space.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Lifts shall not be considered as forming one of the required means of escape as required by this Regulation.</H4></BODY></HTML>
