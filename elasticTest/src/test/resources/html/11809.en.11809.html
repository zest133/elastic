<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 5-1</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Stability information to be supplied to the master*</H3>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer also to the Guidelines for the preparation of intact stability information (<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12507&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.456</A>); Guidance on the intact stability of existing tankers during transfer operations (<A href="UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=12651&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=true">MSC/Circ.706</A>); and the Revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in following and quartering seas (<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=39229&amp;localekey=en">MSC.1/Circ.1228</A>).</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>1 The master shall be supplied with such information satisfactory to the Administration as is necessary to enable him by rapid and simple processes to obtain accurate guidance as to the stability of the ship under varying conditions of service. A copy of the stability information shall be furnished to the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>2 The information should include:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 curves or tables of minimum operational metacentric height (GM) versus draught which assures compliance with the relevant intact and damage stability requirements, alternatively corresponding curves or tables of the maximum allowable vertical centre of gravity (KG) versus draught, or with the equivalents of either of these curves;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 instructions concerning the operation of cross-flooding arrangements; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 all other data and aids which might be necessary to maintain the required intact stability and stability after damage.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 The stability information shall show the influence of various trims in cases where the operational trim range exceeds +/- 0.5% of <EM>Ls</EM>.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>4 For ships which have to fulfil the stability requirements of part B-1, information referred to in paragraph 2 are determined from considerations related to the subdivision index, in the following manner: Minimum required GM (or maximum permissible vertical position of centre of gravity KG) for the three draughts ds, dp and dl are equal to the GM (or KG values) of corresponding loading cases used for the calculation of survival factor si. For intermediate draughts, values to be used shall be obtained by linear interpolation applied to the GM value only between the deepest subdivision draught and the partial subdivision draught and between the partial load line and the light service draught respectively. Intact stability criteria will also be taken into account by retaining for each draft the maximum among minimum required GM values or the minimum of maximum permissible KG values for both criteria. If the subdivision index is calculated for different trims, several required GM curves will be established in the same way.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>5 When curves or tables of minimum operational metacentric height (GM) versus draught are not appropriate, the master should ensure that the operating condition does not deviate from a studied loading condition, or verify by calculation that the stability criteria are satisfied for this loading condition.</H4></BODY></HTML>
