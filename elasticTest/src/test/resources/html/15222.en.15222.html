<h5 class="body1" align="justify">7.4 Evacuation analysis * </h5>

<h6 class="body2" align="justify">Escape routes shall be evaluated by an evacuation analysis early in the design process. The analysis shall be used to identify and eliminate, as far as practicable, congestion which may develop during an abandonment, due to normal movement of passengers and crew along escape routes, including the possibility that crew may need to move along these routes in a direction opposite the movement of passengers. In addition, the analysis shall be used to demonstrate that escape arrangements are sufficiently flexible to provide for the possibility that certain escape routes, assembly stations, embarkation stations or survival craft may not be available as a result of a casualty. </h6>

<h6 class="footnote" align="justify">* Refer to the Interim Guidelines for a simplified evacuation analysis of ro-ro passenger ships (MSC/Circ.909). </h6>
