<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.2.1 The ventilation systems for machinery spaces of category A, vehicle spaces, ro-ro spaces, galleys, special category spaces and cargo spaces shall, in general, be separated from each other and from the ventilation systems serving other spaces. However, the galley ventilation systems on cargo ships of less than 4,000 gross tonnage and in passenger ships carrying not more than 36 passengers need not be completely separated from other ventilation systems, but may be served by separate ducts from a ventilation unit serving other spaces. In such a case, an automatic fire damper shall be fitted in the galley ventilation duct near the ventilation unit.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.2.2 Ducts provided for the ventilation of machinery spaces of category A, galleys, vehicle spaces, ro-ro spaces or special category spaces shall not pass through accommodation spaces, service spaces, or control stations unless they comply with paragraph 7.2.4.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.2.3 Ducts provided for the ventilation of accommodation spaces, service spaces or control stations shall not pass through machinery spaces of category A, galleys, vehicle spaces, ro-ro spaces or special category spaces unless they comply with paragraph 7.2.4.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.2.4 As permitted by paragraphs 7.2.2 and 7.2.3 ducts shall be either:</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.1.1 constructed of steel having a thickness of at least 3 mm for ducts with a free cross-sectional area of less than 0.075 m<SUP>2</SUP>, at least 4 mm for ducts with a free cross-sectional area of between 0.075 m<SUP>2</SUP> and 0.45 m<SUP>2</SUP>, and at least 5 mm for ducts with a free cross-sectional area of over 0.45 m<SUP>2</SUP>;</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.1.2 suitably supported and stiffened;</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.1.3 fitted with automatic fire dampers close to the boundaries penetrated; and</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.1.4 insulated to "A-60" class standard from the boundaries of the spaces they serve to a point at least 5 m beyond each fire damper;</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>or</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.2.1 constructed of steel in accordance with paragraphs 7.2.4.1.1 and 7.2.4.1.2; and</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.2.2 insulated to "A-60" class standard throughout the spaces they pass through, except for ducts that pass through spaces of category (9) or (10) as defined in paragraph 2.2.3.2.2.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.2.5 For the purposes of paragraphs 7.2.4.1.4 and 7.2.4.2.2, ducts shall be insulated over their entire cross-sectional external surface. Ducts that are outside but adjacent to the specified space, and share one or more surfaces with it, shall be considered to pass through the specified space, and shall be insulated over the surface they share with the space for a distance of 450 mm past the duct*.</U></H6>

<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.2.6 Where it is necessary that a ventilation duct passes through a main vertical zone division, an automatic fire damper shall be fitted adjacent to the division. The damper shall also be capable of being manually closed from each side of the division. The control location shall be readily accessible and be clearly and prominently marked. The duct between the division and the damper shall be constructed of steel in accordance with paragraphs 7.2.4.1.1 and 7.2.4.1.2 and insulated to at least the same fire integrity as the division penetrated. The damper shall be fitted on at least one side of the division with a visible indicator showing the operating position of the damper.</U></H6>
