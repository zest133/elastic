<H2 class=part align=center>PART C - MACHINERY INSTALLATIONS</H2>
<H2 class=part align=center>(Except where expressly provided otherwise Part C applies to passenger ships and cargo ships)</H2>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 26</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>General</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The machinery, boilers and other pressure vessels, associated piping systems and fittings shall be of a design and construction adequate for the service for which they are intended and shall be so installed and protected as to reduce to a minimum any danger to persons on board, due regard being paid to moving parts, hot surfaces and other hazards. The design shall have regard to materials used in construction, the purpose for which the equipment is intended, the working conditions to which it will be subjected and the environmental conditions on board.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The Administration shall give special consideration to the reliability of single essential propulsion components and may require a separate source of propulsion power sufficient to give the ship a navigable speed, especially in the case of unconventional arrangements.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Means shall be provided whereby normal operation of propulsion machinery can be sustained or restored even though one of the essential auxiliaries becomes inoperative. Special consideration shall be given to the malfunctioning of:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 a generating set which serves as a main source of electrical power;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 the sources of steam supply;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 the boiler feed water systems;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 the fuel oil supply systems for boilers or engines;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 the sources of lubricating oil pressure;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 the sources of water pressure;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.7 a condensate pump and the arrangements to maintain vacuum in condensers;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.8 the mechanical air supply for boilers;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.9 an air compressor and receiver for starting or control purposes;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.10 the hydraulic, pneumatic or electrical means for control in main propulsion machinery including controllable pitch propellers.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>However, the Administration, having regard to overall safety considerations, may accept a partial reduction in propulsion capability from normal operation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Means shall be provided to ensure that the machinery can be brought into operation from the dead ship condition without external aid.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 All boilers, all parts of machinery, all steam, hydraulic, pneumatic and other systems and their associated fittings which are under internal pressure shall be subjected to appropriate tests including a pressure test before being put into service for the first time.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Main propulsion machinery and all auxiliary machinery essential to the propulsion and the safety of the ship shall, as fitted in the ship, be designed to operate when the ship is upright and when inclined at any angle of list up to and including 15°either way under static conditions and 22.5°under dynamic conditions(rolling) either way and simultaneously inclined dynamically(pitching) 7.5°by bow or stern. The Administration may permit deviation from these angles, taking into consideration the type, size and service conditions of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Provision shall be made to facilitate cleaning, inspection and maintenance of main propulsion and auxiliary machinery including boilers and pressure vessels.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 Special consideration shall be given to the design, construction and installation of propulsion machinery systems so that any mode of their vibrations shall not cause undue stresses in this machinery in the normal operating ranges.</H4></BODY></HTML>
