<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.9 Vent outlets for cargo loading, discharging and ballasting required by paragraph 1.2.2 shall:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.1 permit the free flow of vapour mixtures;or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.2 permit the throttling of the discharge of the vapour mixtures to achieve a velocity of not less than 30m/sec.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 be so arranged that the vapour mixture is discharged vertically upwards;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 where the method is by free flow of vapour mixtures, be such that the outlet shall be not less than 6m above the cargo tank deck or fore and aft gangway if situated within 4m of the gangway and located not less than 10m measured horizontally from the nearest air intakes and openings to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition and from deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 where the method is by high velocity discharge, be located at a height not less than 2m above the cargo tank deck and not less than 10m measured horizontally from the nearest air intakes and openings to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition and from deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard. These outlets shall be provided with high velocity devices of an approved type;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 be designed on the basis of the maximum designed loading rate multiplied by a factor of at least 1.25 to take account of gas evolution, in order to prevent the pressure in any cargo tank from exceeding the design pressure. The master shall be provided with information regarding the maximum permissible loading rate for each cargo tank and in the case of combined venting systems, for each group of cargo tanks.</H6>
