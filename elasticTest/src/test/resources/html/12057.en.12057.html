<H3 class=regulation align=center>Protection against flooding</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Bilge wells in periodically unattended machinery spaces shall be located and monitored in such a way that the accumulation of liquids is detected at normal angles of trim and heel, and shall be large enough to accommodate easily the normal drainage during the unattended period.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Where the bilge pumps are capable of being started automatically, means shall be provided to indicate when the influx of liquid is greater than the pump capacity or when the pump is operating more frequently than would normally be expected. In these cases, smaller bilge wells to cover a reasonable period of time maybe permitted. Where automatically controlled bilge pumps are provided, special attention shall be given to oil pollution prevention requirements.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 The location of the controls of any valve serving a sea inlet, a discharge below the water-line or a bilge injection system shall be so sited as to allow adequate time for operation in case of influx of water to the space, having regard to the time likely to be required in order to reach and operate such controls. If the level to which the space could become flooded with the ship in the fully loaded condition so requires, arrangements shall be made to operate the controls from a position above such level.</H4>
