<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 61</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fixed deck foam systems</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The arrangements for providing foam shall be capable of delivering foam to the entire cargo tanks area as well as into any cargo tank the deck of which has been ruptured.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The deck foam system shall be capable of simple and rapid operation. The main control station for the system shall be suitably located outside the cargo tank area, adjacent to the accommodation spaces and readily accessible and operable in the event of fire in the areas protected.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 The rate of supply of foam solution shall be not less than the greatest of the following:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 0.6ℓ/minute per square metre of cargo deck area, where cargo deck area means the maximum breadth of the ship multiplied by the total longitudinal extent of the cargo tank spaces;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 6ℓ/minute per square metre of the horizontal sectional area of the single tank having the largest such area; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 3ℓ/minute per square metre of the area protected by the largest monitor, such area being entirely forward of the monitor, but not less than 1,250ℓ/minute.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Sufficient foam concentrate shall be supplied to ensure at least 20 minutes of foam generation in tankers fitted with an inert gas installation or 30 minutes of foam generation in tankers not fitted with an inert gas installation when using solution rates stipulated in paragraphs 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3, whichever is the greatest. The foam expansion ratio (i.e. the ratio of the volume of foam produced to the volume of the mixture of water and foam-making concentrate supplied) shall not generally exceed 12 to 1. Where systems essentially produce low expansion foam but at an expansion ratio slightly in excess of 12 to 1 the quantity of foam solution available shall be calculated as for 12 to 1 expansion ratio systems. When medium expansion ratio foam (between 50 to 1 and 150 to 1 expansion ratio) is employed the application rate of the foam and the capacity of a monitor installation shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Foam from the fixed foam system shall be supplied by means of monitors and foam applicators. At least 50 per cent of the foam solution supply rate required in paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 shall be delivered from each monitor. On tankers of less than 4,000 tonnes deadweight the Administration may not require installation of monitors but only applicators. However, in such a case the capacity of each applicator shall be at least 25 percent of the foam solution supply rate required in paragraphs 3.1 or 3.2.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.1 The number and position of monitors shall be such as to comply with paragraph 1. The capacity of any monitor shall be at least 3ℓ/minute of foam solution per square metre of deck area protected by that monitor, such area being entirely forward of the monitor. Such capacity shall be not less than 1,250ℓ/minute.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.2 The distance from the monitor to the farthest extremity of the protected area forward of that monitor shall not be more than 75 percent of the monitor throw in still air conditions.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 A monitor and hose connection for a foam applicator shall be situated both port and starboard at the front of the poop or accommodation spaces facing the cargo deck. On tankers of less than 4,000 tonnes deadweight a hose connection for a foam applicator shall be situated both port and starboard at the front of the poop or accommodation spaces facing the cargo deck.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 Applicators shall be provided to ensure flexibility of action during fire-fighting operations and to cover areas screened from the monitors. The capacity of any applicator shall be not less than 400ℓ and the applicator throw in still air conditions shall be not less than 15 m. The number of foam applicators provided shall be not less than four. The number and disposition of foam main outlets shall be such that foam from at least two applicators can be directed on to any tank deck area.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9 Valves shall be provided in the foam main, and in the fire main when this is an integral part of the deck foam system, immediately forward of any monitor position to isolate damaged sections of those mains.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10 Operation of a deck foam system at its required output shall permit the simultaneous use of the minimum required number of jets of water at the required pressure from the fire main.</H4></BODY></HTML>
