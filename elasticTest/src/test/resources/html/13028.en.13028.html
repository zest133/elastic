<H3 class=regulation align=center>Rigid liferafts</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Rigid liferafts shall comply with the requirements of regulation 38 and, in addition, shall comply with the requirements of this regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Construction of rigid liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 The buoyancy of the liferaft shall be provided by approved inherently buoyant material placed as near as possible to the periphery of the liferaft. The buoyant material shall be fire-retardant or be protected by a fire-retardant covering.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 The floor of the liferaft shall prevent the ingress of water and shall effectively support the occupants out of the water and insulate them from cold.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Carrying capacity of rigid liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>The number of persons which a liferaft shall be permitted to accommodate shall be equal to the lesser of:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 the greatest whole number obtained by dividing by 0.096 the volume, measured in cubic metres of the buoyancy material multiplied by a factor of 1 minus the specific gravity of that material; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 the greatest whole number obtained by dividing by 0.372 the horizontal cross-sectional area of the floor of the liferaft measured in square metres; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 the number of persons having an average mass of 75 kg, all wearing lifejackets, that can be seated with sufficient comfort and headroom without interfering with the operation of any of the liferaft's equipment.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Access into rigid liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 At least one entrance shall be fitted with a rigid boarding ramp to enable persons to board the liferaft from the sea. In the case of a davit-launched liferaft having more than one entrance, the boarding ramp shall be fitted at the entrance opposite to the bowsing and embarkation facilities.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 Entrances not provided with a boarding ramp shall have boarding ladder, the lowest step of which shall be situated not less than 0.4 m below the liferaft's light waterline.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.3 There shall be means inside the liferaft to assist persons to pull themselves into the liferaft from the ladder.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Stability of rigid liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.1 Unless the liferaft is capable of operating safely whichever way up it is floating, its strength and stability shall be such that it is either self-righting or can be readily righted in a seaway and in calm water by one person.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.2 The stability of a liferaft when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment shall be such that it can be towed at speeds of up to 3 knots in calm water.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Rigid liferaft fittings</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.1 The liferaft shall be fitted with an efficient painter. The breaking strength of the painter system, including its means of attachment to the liferaft, except the weak link required by regulation 38.6, shall be not less than 10.0 kN for liferafts permitted to accommodate nine persons or more, and not less than 7.5 kN for any other liferaft.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.2 A manually controlled lamp visible on a dark night with a clear atmosphere at a distance of at least 2 miles for a period of not less than 12 h shall be fitted to the top of the liferaft canopy. If the light is a flashing light it shall flash at a rate of not less than 50 flashes per minute for the first 2 h of operation of the 12 h operating period. The lamp shall be powered by a sea-activated cell or a dry chemical cell and shall light automatically when the liferaft canopy is set in place. The cell shall be of a type that does not deteriorate due to damp or humidity in the stowed liferaft.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.3 A manually controlled lamp shall be fitted inside the liferaft, capable of continuous operation for a period of at least 12 h. It shall light automatically when the canopy is set in place and be of sufficient intensity to enable reading of survival and equipment instructions.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Markings on rigid liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>The liferaft shall be marked with:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 name and port of registry of the ship to which it belongs;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 maker's name or trade mark;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 serial number;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 name of approving authority;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 number of persons it is permitted to accommodate over each entrance in characters not less than 100 mm in height of a colour contrasting with that of the liferaft;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6 SOLAS;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.7 type of emergency pack enclosed;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.8 length of painter;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.9 maximum permitted height of stowage above waterline (drop-test height);</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.10 launching instructions.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 Davit-launched rigid liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>In addition to the above requirements, a rigid liferaft for use with an approved launching appliance shall, when suspended from its lifting hook or bridle, withstand a load of 4 times the mass of its full complement of persons and equipment.</H5></BODY></HTML>
