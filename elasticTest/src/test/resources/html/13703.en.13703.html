<H3 class=regulation align=center>Double bottoms in cargo ships other than tankers</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>(This regulation applies to ships constructed on or after 1 February 1992)</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 A double bottom shall be fitted extending from the collision bulkhead to the afterpeak bulkhead, as far as this is practicable and compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Where a double bottom is required to be fitted, its depth shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration and the inner bottom shall be continued out to the ship's side in such a manner as to protect the bottom to the turn of the bilge.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Small wells constructed in the double bottom, in connection with the drainage arrangements of holds, shall not extend in depth more than necessary. A well extending to the outer bottom, may, however, be permitted at the after end of the shaft tunnel of the ship. Other wells may be permitted by the Administration if it is satisfied that the arrangements give protection equivalent to that afforded by a double bottom complying with this regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 A double bottom need not be fitted in way of watertight compartments used exclusively for the carriage of liquids, provided the safety of the ship in the event of bottom damage is not, in the opinion of the Administration, thereby impaired.</H4>
