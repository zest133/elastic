<H3 class=regulation align=center>Routeing</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The practice of following, particularly in converging areas, routes adopted for the purpose of separation of traffic including avoidance of passage through areas designated as areas to be avoided by ships or certain classes of ships, or for the purpose of avoiding unsafe conditions, has contributed to the safety of navigation and is recommended for use by all ships concerned.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The Organization is recognized as the only international body for establishing and adopting measures on an international level concerning routeing and areas to be avoided by ships or certain classes of ships. It will collate and disseminate to Contracting Governments all relevant information.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The selection of the routes and the initiation of action with regard to them, and the delineation of what constitutes converging areas, will be primarily the responsibility of the Governments concerned. In the development of routeing schemes which impinge upon international waters, or such other schemes they may wish adopted by the Organization, they will give due consideration to relevant information published by the Organization.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) Contracting Governments will use their influence to secure the appropriate use of adopted routes and will do everything in their power to ensure adherence to the measures adopted by the Organization in connexion with routeing of ships.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) Contracting Governments will also induce all ships proceeding on voyages in the vicinity of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to avoid, as far as practicable, the fishing banks of Newfoundland north of latitude 43 degrees N and to pass outside regions known or believed to be endangered by ice.</H4></BODY></HTML>
