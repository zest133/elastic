<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4.1 Means of escape on passenger ships </H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>Means of escape from each machinery space in passenger ships shall comply with the following provisions. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>4.1.1 Escape from spaces below the bulkhead deck </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>Where the space is below the bulkhead deck the two means of escape shall consist of either: </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.1 two sets of steel ladders as widely separated as possible, leading to doors in the upper part of the space similarly separated and from which access is provided to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks. One of these ladders shall be located within a protected enclosure that satisfies regulation 9.2.2.3, category (2), or regulation 9.2.2.4, category (4), as appropriate, from the lower part of the space it serves to a safe position outside the space. Self-closing fire doors of the same fire integrity standards shall be fitted in the enclosure. The ladder shall be fixed in such a way that heat is not transferred into the enclosure through non-insulated fixing points. The protected enclosure shall have minimum internal dimensions of at least 800 mm x 800 mm, and shall have emergency lighting provisions; or </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.2 one steel ladder leading to a door in the upper part of the space from which access is provided to the embarkation deck and additionally, in the lower part of the space and in a position well separated from the ladder referred to, a steel door capable of being operated from each side and which provides access to a safe escape route from the lower part of the space to the embarkation deck. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>4.1.2 Escape from spaces above the bulkhead deck </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>Where the space is above the bulkhead deck, the two means of escape shall be as widely separated as possible and the doors leading from such means of escape shall be in a position from which access is provided to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks. Where such means of escape require the use of ladders, these shall be of steel. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>4.1.3 Dispensation from two means of escape </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>In a ship of less than 1,000 gross tonnage, the Administration may dispense with one of the means of escape, due regard being paid to the width and disposition of the upper part of the space. In a ship of 1,000 gross tonnage and above, the Administration may dispense with one means of escape from any such space, including a normally unattended auxiliary machinery space, so long as either a door or a steel ladder provides a safe escape route to the embarkation deck, due regard being paid to the nature and location of the space and whether persons are normally employed in that space. In the steering gear space, a second means of escape shall be provided when the emergency steering position is located in that space unless there is direct access to the open deck.</H6>
