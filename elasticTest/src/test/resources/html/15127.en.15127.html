<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 15</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Maintenance requirements</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Equipment shall be so designed that the main units can be replaced readily, without elaborate recalibration or readjustment.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Where applicable, equipment shall be so constructed and installed that it is readily accessible for inspection and on-board maintenance purposes.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Adequate information shall be provided to enable the equipment to be properly operated and maintained, taking into account the recommendations of the Organization.*</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Recommendation on general requirements for shipborne radio equipment forming part of the global maritime distress and safety system and for electronic navigational aids, adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7206&amp;localekey=en">A.694((17)</A> and to Resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7291&amp;localekey=en">A.813(19)</A> on general requirements for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) for all electrical and electronic ship's equipment</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Adequate tools and spare shall be provided to enable the equipment to be maintained.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 The Administration shall ensure that radio equipment required by this chapter is maintained to provide the availability of the functional requirements specified in regulation 4 and to meet the recommended performance standards of such equipment.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 On ships engaged on voyages in sea areas A1 and A2, the availability shall be ensured by using such methods as duplication of equipment, shore-based maintenance or at-sea electronic maintenance capability, or a combination of these, as may be approved by the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 On ships engaged on voyages in sea areas A3 and A4, the availability shall be ensured by using a combination of at least two methods such as duplication of equipment, shore-based maintenance or at-sea electronic maintenance capability, as may be approved by the Administration, taking into account the recommendations of the Organization.**</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>** Refer to resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7212&amp;localekey=en">A.702(17)</A> concerning radio maintenance guidelines for the global maritime distress and safety system related to sea area A3 and A4, adopted by the Organization.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 While all reasonable steps shall be taken to maintain the equipment in efficient working order to ensure compliance with all the functional requirements specified in regulation 4, malfunction of the equipment for providing the general radiocommunications required by regulation 4.8 shall not be considered as making a ship unseaworthy or as a reason for delaying the ship in ports where repair facilities are not readily available, provided the ship is capable of performing all distress and safety functions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9 Satellite EPIRB shall be tested at intervals not exceeding 12 months for all aspects of operational efficiency with particular emphasis on frequency stability, signal strength and coding. However, in cases where it appears proper and reasonable, the Administration may extend this period to 17 months. The test may be conducted on board the ship or at an approved testing or servicing station.</H4></BODY></HTML>
