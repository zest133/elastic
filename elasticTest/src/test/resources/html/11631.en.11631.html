<H4 class=subtitle align=left>THE CONFERENCE,</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>NOTING that the Protocols of 1978 Relating to the International Conventions for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS protocol) and to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL Protocol) provide for modifications to the provisions relating to the intervals of surveys and inspections, and the introduction of unscheduled inspections and mandatory annual surveys conducted in lieu of unscheduled inspections of ships,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>REALIZING that the efficiency of such surveys and inspections depends on the national rules promulgated by administrations to give effect to the provisions of the Conventions and Protocols,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>RECOGNIZING that uniform requirements for the extent and particulars of the surveys and inspections can make a valuable contribution to the cause of ensuring continual compliance of ships with the requirements of the Conventions and Protocols,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>RECOGNIZING ALSO that at the present time there are a number of different periods of validity for the Certificates required by the SOLAS and MARPOL Conventions and the International convention on Load lines, 1966, as well as the intervals of intermediate surveys or inspections required by the said Conventions and protocols and that it would be of advantage to standardize these periods and intervals,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>RECOMMENDS that the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization take early action to develop guidelines for Administrations as to the extent, particulars and frequency of such surveys and inspections of ships having due regard to their construction, machinery, equipment and age; these guidelines should also contain requirements for the frequency and scope of unscheduled inspections and the scope of mandatory annual surveys conducted in lieu of unscheduled inspections,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>RECOMMENDS ALSO that in due course the Organization take the necessary action to amend the appropriate instruments with a view to standardizing the periods of validity of the Certificates as well as the intervals of intermediate surveys and inspections required by the above-mentioned Conventions and Protocols.</H5></BODY></HTML>
