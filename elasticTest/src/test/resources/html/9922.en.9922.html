<H3 class=regulation align=center>Basic Principles</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>The purpose of this Chapter is to require the fullest practicable degree of fire protection, fire detection and fire extinction in ships. The following basic principles underlie the Regulations in this Chapter and are embodied in the Regulations as appropriate, having regard to the type of ships and the potential fire hazard involved:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(a) division of ship into main vertical zones by thermal and structural boundaries;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(b) separation of accommodation spaces from the remainder of the ship by thermal and structural boundaries;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(c) restricted use of combustible materials;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(d) detection of any fire in the zone of origin;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(e) containment and extinction of any fire in the space of origin;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(f) protection of means of escape or access for fire fighting;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(g) ready availability of fire-extinguishing appliances;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(h) minimization of possibility of ignition of inflammable<STRONG>*</STRONG> cargo vapour.</H5>
