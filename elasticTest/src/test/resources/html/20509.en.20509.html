<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The system shall be capable of:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 inerting empty cargo tanks by reducing the oxygen content of the atmosphere in each tank to a level at which combustion cannot be supported;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 maintaining the atmosphere in any part of any cargo tank with an oxygen content not exceeding 8 per cent by volume and at a positive pressure at all times in port and at sea except when it is necessary for such a tank to be gas free;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 eliminating the need for air to enter a tank during normal operations except when it is necessary for such a tank to be gas free;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 purging empty cargo tanks of hydrocarbon gas, so that subsequent gas freeing operations will at no time create a flammable atmosphere within the tank.</H5>
