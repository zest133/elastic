<H3 class=regulation align=center>Openings in "A" class divisions</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Except for hatches between cargo, special category, store, and baggage spaces, and between such spaces and the weather decks, all openings shall be provided with permanently attached means of closing which shall be at least as effective for resisting fires as the divisions in which they are fitted.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The construction of all doors and door frames in "A" class divisions, with the means of securing them when closed, shall provide resistance to fire as well as to the passage of smoke and flame, as far as practicable, equivalent to that of the bulkheads in which the doors are situated. Such doors and door frames shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material. Watertight doors need not be insulated.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 It shall be possible for each door to be opened and closed from each side of the bulkhead by one person only.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Fire doors in main vertical zone bulkheads, galley boundaries and stairway enclosures other than power-operated watertight doors and those which are normally locked, shall satisfy the following requirements:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 the doors shall be self-closing and be capable of closing against an angle of inclination of up to 3.5˚opposing closure.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 the approximate time of closure for hinged fire doors shall be no more than 40s and no less than 10s from the beginning of their movement with the ship in upright position. The approximate uniform rate of closure for sliding fire doors shall be of no more than 0.2 m/s and no less than 0.1 m/s with the ship in the upright position.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 the doors shall be capable of remote release from the continuously manned central control station, either simultaneously or in groups and shall be capable of release also individually from a position at both sides of the door. Release switches shall have an on-off function to prevent automatic resetting of the system.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 hold-back hooks not subject to central control station release are prohibited.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 a door closed remotely from the central control station shall be capable of being re-opened at both sides of the door by local control. After such local opening, the door shall automatically close again.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 indication shall be provided at the fire door indicator panel in the continuously manned central control station whether each of the remote-released doors are closed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.7 the release mechanism shall be so designed that the door will automatically close in the event of disruption of the control system or main source of electric power.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.8 local power accumulators for power-operated doors shall be provided in the immediate vicinity of the doors to enable the doors to be operated after disruption of the control system or main source of electric power at least 10(ten) times (fully opened and closed) using the local controls.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.9 disruption of the control system or main source of electric power at one door shall not impair the safe functioning of the other doors.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.10 remote-released sliding or power-operated doors shall be equipped with an alarm that sounds for at least 5s but no more than 10s after the door is released from the central control station and before the door begins to move and continue sounding until the door is completely closed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.11 a door designed to re-open upon contacting an object in its path shall re-open not more than 1 m from the point of contact.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.12 double-leaf doors equipped with a latch necessary to their fire integrity shall have a latch that is automatically activated by the operation of the doors when released by the control system.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.13 doors giving direct access to special category spaces which are power-operated and automatically closed need not be equipped with the alarms and remote-release mechanisms required in .3 and .10.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.14 the components of the local control system shall be accessible for maintenance and adjusting and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.15 power-operated doors shall be provided with a control system of an approved type which shall be able to operate in case of fire, this being determined in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code. This system shall satisfy the following requirements.</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.15.1 the control system shall be able to operate the door at the temperature of at least 200°C for at least 60 min, served by the power supply;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.15.2 the power supply for all other doors not subject to fire shall not be impaired and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.15.3 at temperatures exceeding 200°C the control system shall be automatically isolated from the power supply and shall be capable of keeping the door closed up to at least 945°C.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 In ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, where a space is protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of Regulation 12 or fitted with a continuous "B" class ceiling, openings in decks not forming steps in main vertical zones nor bounding horizontal zones shall be closed reasonably tight and such decks shall meet the "A" class integrity requirements in so far as is reasonable and practicable in the opinion of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 The requirements for "A" class integrity of the outer boundaries of the ship shall not apply to glass partitions, windows an sidescuttles provided that there is no requirement for such boundaries to have "A" class integrity in regulation 33.3. The requirements for "A" class integrity of the outer boundaries of the ship shall not apply to exterior doors, except for those in superstructures and deckhouses facing life-saving appliances, embarkation and external muster station areas, external stairs and open decks used for escape routes. Stairway enclosure doors need not meet this requirement.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 All "A" class doors located in stairways, public spaces and main vertical zone bulkheads in escape routes shall be equipped with a self-closing hose port of material, construction and fire resistance which is equivalent to the door into which it is fitted, and shall be a 150mm square clear opening with the door closed and shall be inset into the lower edge of the door, opposite the door hinges, or in the case of sliding doors, nearest the opening.</H4>
