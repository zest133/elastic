<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>6 Protection of cargo tank structure against pressure or vacuum in tankers </H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>6.1 General </H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>The venting arrangements shall be so designed and operated as to ensure that neither pressure nor vacuum in cargo tanks shall exceed design parameters and be such as to provide for: </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 the flow of the small volumes of vapour, air or inert gas mixtures caused by thermal variations in a cargo tank in all cases through pressure/vacuum valves; and </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 the passage of large volumes of vapour, air or inert gas mixtures during cargo loading and ballasting, or during discharging. </H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>6.2 Openings for small flow by thermal variations </H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>Openings for pressure release required by paragraph 6.1.1 shall: </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 have as great a height as is practicable above the cargo tank deck to obtain maximum dispersal of flammable vapours, but in no case less than 2 m above the cargo tank deck; and </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 be arranged at the furthest distance practicable but not less than 5 m from the nearest air intakes and openings to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition and from deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard. Anchor windlass and chain locker openings constitute an ignition hazard. <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=174&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 70</A></H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>6.3 Safety measures in cargo tanks </H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>6.3.1 Preventive measures against liquid rising in the venting system <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=175&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 71</A></H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>Provisions shall be made to guard against liquid rising in the venting system to a height which would exceed the design head of cargo tanks. This shall be accomplished by high-level alarms or overflow control systems or other equivalent means, together with independent gauging devices and cargo tank filling procedures. For the purposes of this regulation, spill valves are not considered equivalent to an overflow system. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>6.3.2 Secondary means for pressure/vacuum relief <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=244&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 140</A></H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>A secondary means of allowing full flow relief of vapour, air or inert gas mixtures to prevent over-pressure or under-pressure in the event of failure of the arrangements in paragraph 6.1.2. Alternatively, pressure sensors may be fitted in each tank protected by the arrangement required in paragraph 6.1.2, with a monitoring system in the ship's cargo control room or the position from which cargo operations are normally carried out. Such monitoring equipment shall also provide an alarm facility which is activated by detection of over-pressure or under-pressure conditions within a tank. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>6.3.3 Bypasses in vent mains </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>Pressure/vacuum valves required by paragraph 6.1.1 may be provided with a bypass arrangement when they are located in a vent main or masthead riser. Where such an arrangement is provided there shall be suitable indicators to show whether the bypass is open or closed. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>6.3.4 Pressure/vacuum-breaking devices </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>One or more pressure/vacuum-breaking devices shall be provided to prevent the cargo tanks from being subject to: </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.1 a positive pressure, in excess of the test pressure of the cargo tank, if the cargo were to be loaded at the maximum rated capacity and all other outlets are left shut; and </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.2 a negative pressure in excess of 700 mm water gauge if cargo were to be discharged at the maximum rated capacity of the cargo pumps and the inert gas blowers were to fail. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>Such devices shall be installed on the inert gas main unless they are installed in the venting system required by regulation 4.5.3.1 or on individual cargo tanks. The location and design of the devices shall be in accordance with regulation 4.5.3 and paragraph 6. </H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>6.4 Size of vent outlets </H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>Vent outlets for cargo loading, discharging and ballasting required by paragraph 6.1.2 shall be designed on the basis of the maximum designed loading rate multiplied by a factor of at least 1.25 to take account of gas evolution, in order to prevent the pressure in any cargo tank from exceeding the design pressure. The master shall be provided with information regarding the maximum permissible loading rate for each cargo tank and in the case of combined venting systems, for each group of cargo tanks. </H6></BODY></HTML>
