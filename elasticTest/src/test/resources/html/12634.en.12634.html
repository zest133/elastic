<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fixed fire detection and fire alarm systems for</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>periodically unattended machinery spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 A fixed fire detection and fire alarm system of an approved type in accordance with the relevant provisions of Regulation 13 shall be installed in periodically unattended machinery spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 This fire detection system shall be so designed and the detectors so positioned as to detect rapidly the onset of fire in any part of those spaces and under any normal conditions of operation of the machinery and variations of ventilation as required by the possible range of ambient temperatures. Except in spaces of restricted height and where their use is specially appropriate, detection systems using only thermal detectors shall not be permitted. The detection system shall initiate audible and visual alarms distinct in both respects from the alarms of any other system not indicating fire, insufficient places to ensure that the alarms are heard and observed on the navigating bridge and by a responsible engineer officer. When the navigating bridge is unmanned the alarm shall sound in a place where a responsible member of the crew is on duty.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 After installation the system shall be tested under varying conditions of engine operation and ventilation.</H4></BODY></HTML>
