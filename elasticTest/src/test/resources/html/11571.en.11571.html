<H3 class=regulation align=center>Steering Gear*</H3>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Reference is made to the Recommendation on Steering Gear for Large Ships, adopted by the Organization by Resolution A.210(VII).</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Passenger Ships and Cargo Ships.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Ships shall be provided with a main steering gear and an auxiliary steering gear to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) The main steering gear shall be of adequate strength and sufficient to steer the ship at maximum service speed. The main steering gear and rudder stock shall be so designed that they are not damaged at maximum astern speed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) The auxiliary steering gear shall be of adequate strength and sufficient to steer the ship at navigable speed and capable of being brought speedily into action in an emergency.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) The exact position of the rudder, if power operated, shall be indicated at the principal steering station.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Passenger Ships only.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The main steering gear shall be capable of putting the rudder over from 35 degrees on one side to 35 degrees on the other side with the ship running ahead at maximum service speed. The rudder shall be capable of being put over from 35 degrees on either side to 30 degrees on the other side in 28 seconds at maximum service speed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) The auxiliary steering gear shall be operated by power in any case in which the Administration would require a rudder stock of over 228.6 millimetres (9 inches) diameter in way of the tiller.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) Where main steering gear power units and their connections are fitted in duplicate to the satisfaction of the Administration, and each power unit enables the steering gear to meet the requirements of sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph, no auxiliary steering gear need be required.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) Where the Administration would require a rudder stock with a diameter in way of the tiller exceeding 228.6 millimetres (9 inches) there shall be provided an alternative steering station located to the satisfaction of the Administration. The remote steering control systems from the principal and alternative steering stations shall be so arranged to the satisfaction of the Administration that failure of either system would not result in inability to steer the ship by means of the other system.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(v) Means satisfactory to the Administration shall be provided to enable orders to be transmitted from the bridge to the alternative steering station</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Cargo Ships only.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The auxiliary steering gear shall be operated by power in any case in which the Administration would require a rudder stock of over 355.6 millimetres (14 inches) diameter in way of the tiller.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Where power-operated steering gear units and connections are fitted in duplicate to the satisfaction of the Administration, and each unit complies with sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph (a) of this Regulation, no auxiliary steering gear need be required, provided that the duplicate units and connections operating together comply with sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of this Regulation.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) Tankers only</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The following shall apply to every new tanker of 10,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards and, not later than two years from the date of entry into force of the present Protocol, to every existing tanker of 10,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) two remote steering gear control systems shall be provided, each of which shall be operable separately from the navigating bridge. This does not require duplication of the steering wheel or steering lever. In the event of failure of the remote steering gear control system in operation, the other system shall be capable of being brought into immediate operation from a position on the navigating bridge. Each remote steering gear control system, if electric, shall be served by its own separate circuit supplied from the steering gear power circuit from a point within the steering gear compartment. In the event of failure of electrical power supply to a remote steering gear control system an alarm shall be given on the navigating bridge. The alarms required in this sub-paragraph shall be both audible and visual and situated in a position on the navigating bridge where they can be readily observed;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) control of the main steering gear shall also be provided in the steering gear compartment;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(3) means shall be provided in the steering gear compartment to disconnect the remote steering gear control system from the power circuit;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(4) a means of communication shall be provided between the navigating bridge and the steering gear compartment;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(5) the exact angular position of the rudder shall be indicated on the navigating bridge. The rudder angle indication shall be independent of the remote steering gear control system; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(6) the angular position of the rudder shall be recognizable in the steering gear compartment.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) In every new tanker of 10,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) and sub-paragraph (d)(i) of this Regulation, the following shall apply:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) the main steering gear shall comprise two or more identical power units and it shall be capable of operating the rudder as required by sub-paragraph (d)(ii)(2) of this Regulation while operating with one or more power units. As far as reasonable and practicable, the main steering gear shall be so arranged that a single failure in its piping or in one of the power units will not impair the integrity of the remaining part of the steering gear. All mechanical couplings which are part of the steering gear and the mechanical connection with any remote steering gear control system, if any, shall be of sound and reliable construction to the satisfaction of the Administration;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) the main steering gear shall, with the ship at its deepest sea-going draught, be capable of putting the rudder over from 35 degrees on one side to 35 degrees on the other side with the ship running ahead at maximum service speed. The rudder shall be capable of being put over from 35 degrees on either side to 30 degrees on the other side in not more than 28 seconds, under the same conditions;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(3) the main steering gear shall be operated by power where necessary to fulfil the requirements of sub-paragraph (d)(ii)(2) of this Regulation;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(4) the main steering gear power units shall be arranged to start automatically when power is restored after a power failure;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(5) in the event of failure of any of the steering gear power units an alarm shall be given on the navigating bridge. Every steering gear power unit shall be capable of being brought into operation either automatically or manually from a position on the navigating bridge; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(6) an alternative power supply, at least sufficient to supply a steering gear power unit so as to enable it to move the rudder as specified below, and also to supply its associated remote steering gear control system and the rudder angle indicator, shall be provided, automatically, within 45 seconds, either from the emergency source of electrical power, or from another independent source of power located in the steering gear compartment. This independent source of power shall be used only for this purpose and shall have a capacity sufficient for half an hour of continuous operation. The steering gear power unit, when being supplied by the alternative power supply, shall at least be capable of putting the rudder over from 15 degrees on one side to 15 degrees on the other side in not more than 60 seconds with the ship at its deepest sea-going draught while running at one half of its maximum service speed ahead or 7 knots, whichever is the greater.</H6></BODY></HTML>
