<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Fixed gas fire-extinguishing systems</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>1 General.</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.1 The use of a fire-extinguishing medium which, in the opinion of the Administration, either by itself or under expected conditions of use gives off toxic gases in such quantities as to endanger persons shall not be permitted.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.2 The necessary pipes for conveying fire-extinguishing medium into protected spaces shall be provided with control valves so marked as to indicate clearly the spaces to which the pipes are led. Suitable provision shall be made to prevent inadvertent admission of the medium to any space. Where a cargo space fitted with a gas fire-extinguishing system is used as a passenger space the gas connection shall be blanked during such use.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.3 The piping for the distribution of fire-extinguishing medium shall be arranged and discharge nozzles so positioned that a uniform distribution of medium is obtained. </H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.4 Means shall be provided to close all openings which may admit air to or allow gas to escape from a protected space.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.5 Where the volume of free air contained in air receivers in any space is such that, if released in such space in the event of fire, such release of air within that space would seriously affect the efficiency of the fixed fire-extinguishing system, the Administration shall require the provision of an additional quantity of fire-extinguishing medium.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.6 Means shall be provided for automatically giving audible warning of the release of fire-extinguishing medium into any space in which personnel normally work or to which they have access. The alarm shall operate for a suitable period before the medium is released.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.7 The means of control of any fixed gas fire-extinguishing system shall be readily accessible and simple to operate and shall be grouped together in as few locations as possible at positions not likely to be cut off by a fire in a protected space. At each location there shall be clear instructions relating to the operation of the system having regard to the safety of personnel.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.8 Automatic release of fire-extinguishing medium shall not be permitted, except as permitted by paragraph 3.3.5 and in respect of local automatically operated units referred to in paragraphs 3.4 and 3.5.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.9 Where the quantity of extinguishing medium is required to protect more than one space, the quantity of medium available need not be more than the largest quantity required for any one space so protected.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.10 Except as otherwise permitted by paragraphs 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5 pressure containers required for the storage of fire-extinguishing medium, other than steam, shall be located outside protected spaces in accordance with paragraph 1.13.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.11 Means shall be provided for the crew to safely check the quantity of medium in the containers.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.12 Containers for the storage of fire-extinguishing medium and associated pressure components shall be designed to pressure codes of practice to the satisfaction of the Administration having regard to their locations and maximum ambient temperatures expected in service.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.13 When the fire-extinguishing medium is stored outside a protected space, it shall be stored in a room which shall be situated in a safe and readily accessible position and shall be effectively ventilated to the satisfaction of the Administration. Any entrance to such a storage room shall preferably be from the open deck and in any case shall be independent of the protected space. Access doors shall open outwards, and bulkheads and decks including doors and other means of closing any opening therein, which form the boundaries between such rooms and adjoining enclosed spaces shall be gastight. For the purpose of the application of the integrity tables in Regulations 26, 27, 44 and 58, such storage rooms shall be treated as control stations.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.14 Spare parts for the system shall be stored on board and be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 Carbon dioxide systems</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.1 For cargo spaces the quantity of carbon dioxide available shall, unless otherwise provided, be sufficient to give a minimum volume of free gas equal to 30 percent of the gross volume of the largest cargo space so protected in the ship.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.2 For machinery spaces the quantity of carbon dioxide carried shall be sufficient to give a minimum quantity of free gas equal to the larger of the following quantities, either:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 40 percent of the gross volume of the largest machinery space so protected, the volume to exclude that part of the casing above the level at which the horizontal area of the casing is 40 percent or less of the horizontal area of the space concerned taken midway between the tank top and the lowest part of the casing; or </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 35 percent of the gross volume of the largest machinery space protected, including the casing; </H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>provided that the above-mentioned percentages may be reduced to 35 percent and 30 percent respectively for cargo ships of less than 2,000 tons gross tonnage; provided also that if two or more machinery spaces are not entirely separate they shall be considered as forming one space.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.3 For the purpose of this paragraph the volume of free carbon dioxide shall be calculated at 0.56mÂ³/kg.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.4 For machinery spaces the fixed piping system shall be such that 85 percent of the gas can be discharged into the space within 2 minutes.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 Halogenated hydrocarbon systems</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3.1 The use of halogenated hydrocarbons as fire-extinguishing media is only permitted in machinery spaces, pumprooms and in cargo spaces intended solely for the carriage of vehicles which are not carrying any cargo.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3.2 When halogenated hydrocarbons are used as the fire-extinguishing media in total flooding systems:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 The system shall be arranged for manual initiation of power release only.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 If the charge of halogenated hydrocarbon is required to supply more than one space, the arrangements for its storage and release shall be such that compliance with paragraphs 3.2.9 or 3.2.10 respectively, is obtained.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.3 Means shall be provided for automatically stopping all ventilation fans serving the protected space before the medium is released.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.4 Means shall be provided to manually close all dampers in the ventilation system serving a protected space.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.5 The discharge arrangements shall be so designed that the minimum quantity of medium required for cargo spaces or machinery spaces in paragraphs 3.2.9 or 3.2.10 respectively can be substantially discharged in a nominal 20 seconds or less based on the discharge of the liquid phase.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.6 The system shall be designed to operate within a temperature range to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.7 The discharge shall not endanger personnel engaged on maintenance of equipment or using the normal access ladders and escapes serving the space.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.8 Means shall be provided for the crew to safely check the pressure within containers.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.9 The quantity of extinguishing medium for cargo spaces intended solely for the carriage of vehicles which are not carrying any cargo shall be calculated in accordance with table 5.1. This quantity shall be based on the gross volume of the protected space. In respect of Halon 1301 and 1211, the quantity shall be calculated on a volumetric ratio basis, and in respect of Halon 2402 on a mass per unit volume basis.</H6>

<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.11 For the purpose of paragraphs 3.2.9 and 3.2.10, the volume of Halon 1301 shall be calculated at 0.16mÂ³/kg and the volume of Halon 1211 shall be calculated at 0.14mÂ³/kg.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3.3 Only Halon 1301 may be stored within a protected machinery space. Containers shall be individually distributed throughout that space and the following requirements shall be complied with:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 A manually initiated power release, located outside the protected space, shall be provided. Duplicate sources of power shall be provided for this release and shall be located outside the protected space and be immediately available except that for machinery spaces, one of the sources of power may be located inside the protected space.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 Electric power circuits connecting the containers shall be monitored for fault conditions and loss of power. Visual and audible alarms shall be provided to indicate this.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.3 Pneumatic or hydraulic power circuits connecting the containers shall be duplicated. The sources of pneumatic or hydraulic pressure shall be monitored for loss of pressure. Visual and audible alarms shall be provided to indicate this.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.4 Within the protected space, electrical circuits essential for the release of the system shall be heat resistant e.g. mineral insulated cable or equivalent. Piping systems essential for the release of systems designed to be operated hydraulically or pneumatically shall be of steel or other equivalent heat-resisting material to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.5 Each pressure container shall be fitted with an automatic over-pressure release device which, in the event of the container being exposed to the effects of fire and the system not being operated, will safely vent the contents of the container into the protected space.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.6 The arrangement of containers and the electrical circuits and piping essential for the release of any system shall be such that in the event of damage to any one power release line through fire or explosion in a protected space, i.e. a single fault concept, at least two-thirds of the fire-extinguishing charge required by paragraphs 3.2.9 or 3.2.10 for that space can still be discharged having regard to the requirement for uniform distribution of medium throughout the space. The arrangements in respect of systems for spaces requiring only one or two containers shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.7 Not more than two discharge nozzles shall be fitted to any pressure container and the maximum quantity of agent in each container shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration having regard to the requirement for uniform distribution of medium throughout the space.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.8 The containers shall be monitored for decrease in pressure due to leakage and discharge. Visual and audible alarms in the protected area and on the navigating bridge or in the space where the fire control equipment is centralized shall be provided to indicate this condition, except that for cargo spaces, alarms are only required on the navigating bridge or the space where the fire control equipment is centralized.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3.4 Local automatically operated fixed fire-extinguishing units containing Halon 1301 or 1211, fitted in enclosed areas of high fire risk within machinery spaces, in addition to, and independent of, any required fixed fire-extinguishing system may be accepted subject to compliance with the following:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 The space in which such additional local protection is provided shall preferably be on one working level and on the same level as the access. At the discretion of the Administration more than one working level may be permitted subject to an access being provided on each level.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 The size of the space and arrangements of accesses thereto and machinery therein, shall be such that escape from anywhere in the space can be effected in not more than 10 seconds.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.3 The operation of any unit shall be signalled both visually and audibly outside each access to the machinery space and at the navigating bridge or in the space where the fire control equipment is centralized.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.4 A notice indicating that the space contains one or more automatically operated fire-extinguishing units and stating which medium is used, shall be displayed outside each access thereto.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.5 Discharge nozzles shall be so positioned that the discharge does not endanger personnel using the normal access ladders and escapes serving the compartment. Provision shall also be made to protect personnel engaged in maintenance of machinery from inadvertent discharge of the medium.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.6 The fire-extinguishing units shall be designed to operate within a temperature range to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.7 Means shall be provided for the crew to safely check the pressure within the containers.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.8 The total quantity of extinguishing medium provided in the local automatically operated units shall be such that a concentration of 7 percent in respect of Halon 1301 and 5.5 percent in respect of Halon 1211 at 20Â°C based on the net volume of the enclosed space is not exceeded. This requirement applies when either a local automatically operated unit or a fixed system fitted in compliance with paragraph 3.2 has operated, but not when both have operated. The volume of Halon 1301 shall be calculated at 0.16mÂ³/kg and the volume of Halon 1211 shall be calculated at 0.14mÂ³/kg.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.9 The time of discharge of a unit, based on the discharge of the liquid phase, shall be 10 seconds or less.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.10 The arrangement of local automatically operated fire-extinguishing units shall be such that their release does not result in loss of electrical power or reduction of the manoeuvr ability of the ship.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3.5 Automatically operated fire-extinguishing units, as described in paragraph 3.4, fitted in machinery spaces over equipment having a high fire risk, in addition to and independent of any required fixed fire-extinguishing system, may be accepted subject to compliance with paragraphs 3.4.3 to 3.4.6, 3.4.9 and 3.4.10 and with the following:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 The quantity of medium provided in local automatically operated units shall be such that a vapour in air concentration not greater than 1.25 percent at 20Â°C based on the gross volume of the machinery space is obtained in the event of their simultaneous operation.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 The volume of Halon 1301 shall be calculated at 0.16mÂ³/kg and the volume of Halon 1211 shall be calculated at 0.14mÂ³/kg.</H6>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4 Steam systems</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>In general, the Administration shall not permit the use of steam as afire-extinguishing medium in fixed fire-extinguishing systems. Where the use of steam is permitted by the Administration it shall be used only in restricted areas as an addition to the required fire-extinguishing medium and with the proviso that the boiler or boilers available for supplying steam shall have an evaporation of at least 1.0kg of steam per hour for each 0.75mÂ³of the gross volume of the largest space so protected. In addition to complying with the foregoing requirements the systems in all respects shall be as determined by, and to the satisfaction of, the Administration.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>5 Other gas systems</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>5.1 Where gas other than carbon dioxide or halogenated hydrocarbons, or steam as permitted by paragraph 4 is produced on the ship and is used as a fire-extinguishing medium, it shall be a gaseous product of fuel combustion in which the oxygen content, the carbon monoxide content, the corrosive elements and any solid combustible elements have been reduced to a permissible minimum.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>5.2 Where such gas is used as the fire-extinguishing medium in a fixed fire-extinguishing system for the protection of machinery spaces it shall afford protection equivalent to that provided by a fixed system using carbon dioxide as the medium.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>5.3 Where such gas is used as a fire-extinguishing medium in a fixed fire-extinguishing system for the protection of cargo spaces, a sufficient quantity of such gas shall be available to supply hourly a volume of free gas at least equal to 25 percent of the gross volume of the largest space protected in this way for a period of 72 hours.</H5></BODY></HTML>
