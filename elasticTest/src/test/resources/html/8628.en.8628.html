<H3 class=regulation align=center>Radiotelephone installations</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The radiotelephone installation shall include transmitting and receiving equipment, and appropriate sources of energy (referred to in the following paragraphs as "the transmitter", "the receiver", "the radiotelephone distress frequency watch receiver", and "the source of energy" respectively).</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The transmitter shall be capable of transmitting on the radiotelephone distress frequency and on at least one other frequency in the bands between 1,605 kHzand 2,850 kHz, using the classes of emission assigned by the Radio Regulations for these frequencies. In normal operation a double sideband transmission or a single sideband transmission with full carrier shall have a depth of modulation of at least 70 per cent at peak intensity. Modulation of a single sideband transmission with reduced or suppressed carrier shall be such that the intermodulation products shall not exceed the values given in the Radio Regulations.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c)</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) In the case of cargo ships of 300 tons gross tonnage and upwards but less than 1,600 tons gross tonnage the transmitter shall have a minimum normal range of 150 miles, i.e. it shall be capable of transmitting clearly perceptible signals from ship to ship by day and under normal conditions and circumstances over this range.* (Clearly perceptible signals will normally be received if the R.M.S. value of the field strength produced at the receiver by an unmodulated carrier is at least 25 microvolts per metre for double sideband and single sideband full carrier emissions.)</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* In the absence of field strength measurements, it may be assumed that this range will be obtained by a power in the antenna of 15 watts (unmodulated carrier) with an antenna efficiency of 27 per cent for double sideband emissions or 60 watts peak envelope power for single sideband full carrier emissions when 100 per cent modulated by a single sinusoidal oscillation</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) In the case of existing installations using double sideband emissions on cargo ships of 300 tons gross tonnage and upwards but less than 500 tons gross tonnage, the transmitter shall have a minimum normal range of at least 75 miles.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The transmitter shall be fitted with a device for generating the radiotelephone alarm signal by automatic means so designed as to prevent actuation by mistake. The device shall be capable of being taken out of operation at any time in order to permit the immediate transmission of a distress message. Arrangements shall be made to check periodically the proper functioning of the device on frequencies other than the radiotelephone distress frequency using a suitable artificial antenna.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) The device required by paragraph (d) of this regulation shall comply with the following requirements:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The tolerance of the frequency of each tone shall be +/-1.5 percent.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) The tolerance on the duration of each tone shall be +/-50 milliseconds.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) The interval between successive tones shall not exceed 50 milliseconds.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) The ratio of the amplitude of the stronger tone to that of the weaker shall be within the range 1 to 1.2.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) The receiver required by paragraph (a) of this regulation shall be capable of receiving the radiotelephone distress frequency and at least one other frequency available for maritime radiotelephone stations in the bands between 1,605 kHzand 2,850 kHz, using the classes of emission assigned by the Radio Regulations for these frequencies. In addition the receiver shall permit the reception of such other frequencies, using the classes of emission assigned by the Radio Regulations, as are used for the transmission by radiotelephony of meteorological messages and such other communications relating to the safety of navigation as may be considered necessary by the Administration. The receiver shall have sufficient sensitivity to produce signals by means of a loudspeaker when the receiver input is as low as 50 microvolts.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) The radiotelephone distress frequency watch receiver shall be preset to this frequency. It shall be provided with a filtering unit or a device to silence the loudspeaker in the absence of a radiotelephone alarm signal. The device shall be capable of being easily switched in and out and may be used when, in the opinion of the master, conditions are such that maintenance of the listening watch would interfere with the safe navigation of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) To permit rapid change-over from transmission to reception when manual switching is used, the control for the switching device shall, where practicable, be located on the microphone or the telephone handset.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(i) While the ship is at sea, there shall be available at all times a main source of energy sufficient to operate the installation over the normal range required by paragraph (c) of this Regulation. If batteries are provided they shall under all circumstances have sufficient capacity to operate the transmitter and receiver for at least six hours continuously under normal working conditions.* In installations in cargo ships of 500 tons gross tonnage and upwards but less than 1,600 tons gross tonnage made on or after 19 November 1952, a reserve source of energy shall be provided in the upper part of the ship unless the main source of energy is so situated.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* For the purpose of determining the electrical load to be supplied by batteries required to have six hours reserve capacity, the following formula is recommended as a guide:</H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>1/2 of the current consumption necessary for speech transmission</H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>+ current consumption of receiver</H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>+ current consumption of all additional loads to which the batteries may supply energy in time of distress or emergency.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(j) The reserve source of energy, if provided, may be used only to supply:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) the radiotelephone installation;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) the emergency light required by paragraph (d) of Regulation 15 of this Chapter;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) the device required by paragraph (d) of this Regulation, for generating the radiotelephone alarm signal; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) the VHF installation in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 17(c).</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(k) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (j) of this regulation, the Administration may authorize the use of the reserve source of energy, if provided, for a direction-finder, if fitted, and for a number of low-power emergency circuits which are wholly confined to the upper part of the ship, such as emergency lighting on the boat deck, on condition that the additional loads can be readily disconnected, and that the source of energy is of sufficient capacity to carry them.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(l) While at sea, any battery provided shall be kept charged so as to meet the requirements of paragraph (i) of this Regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(m) An antenna shall be provided and installed and, if suspended between supports liable to whipping, shall in the case of cargo ships of 500 tons gross tonnage and upwards but less than 1,600 tons gross tonnage be protected against breakage. In addition, there shall be a spare antenna completely assembled for immediate replacement or, where this is not practicable, sufficient antenna wire and insulators to enable a spare antenna to be erected. The necessary tools to erect an antenna shall also be provided.</H4>
