<H3 class=regulation style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Regulation 13</H3>
<H3 class=regulation style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Openings in watertight bulkheads below the bulkhead deck in passenger ships</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">1 The number of openings in watertight bulkheads shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship, satisfactory means shall be provided for closing these openings.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">2.1 Where pipes, scuppers, electric cables, etc., are carried through watertight bulkheads, arrangements shall be made to ensure the watertight integrity of the bulkheads.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">2.2 Valves not forming part of a piping system shall not be permitted in watertight bulkheads.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">2.3 Lead or other heat sensitive materials shall not be used in systems which penetrate watertight bulkheads, where deterioration of such systems in the event of fire would impair the watertight integrity of the bulkheads.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">3 No doors, manholes, or access openings are permitted in watertight transverse bulkheads dividing a cargo space from an adjoining cargo space, except as provided in paragraph 9.1 and in regulation 14.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">4 Subject to paragraph 10, not more than one door, apart from the doors to shaft tunnels, may be fitted in each watertight bulkhead within spaces containing the main and auxiliary propulsion machinery including boilers serving the needs of propulsion. Where two or more shafts are fitted, the tunnels shall be connected by an intercommunicating passage. There shall be only one door between the machinery space and the tunnel spaces where two shafts are fitted and only two doors where there are more than two shafts. All these doors shall be of the sliding type and shall be so located as to have their sills as high as practicable. The hand gear for operating these doors from above the bulkhead deck shall be situated outside the spaces containing the machinery.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">5.1 Watertight doors, except as provided in paragraph 9.1 or regulation 14, shall be power-operated sliding doors complying with the requirements of paragraph 7 capable of being closed simultaneously from the central operating console at the navigation bridge in not more than 60 s with the ship in the upright position.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">5.2 The means of operation whether by power or by hand of any power-operated sliding watertight door shall be capable of closing the door with the ship listed to 15<SUP>o</SUP> either way. Consideration shall also be given to the forces which may act on either side of the door as may be experienced when water is flowing through the opening applying a static head equivalent to a water height of at least 1 m above the sill on the centreline of the door.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">5.3 Watertight door controls, including hydraulic piping and electric cables, shall be kept as close as practicable to the bulkhead in which the doors are fitted, in order to minimize the likelihood of them being involved in any damage which the ship may sustain. The positioning of watertight doors and their controls shall be such that if the ship sustains damage within one fifth of the breadth of the ship, as defined in regulation 2, such distance being measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision draught, the operation of the watertight doors clear of the damaged portion of the ship is not impaired.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">6 All power-operated sliding watertight doors shall be provided with means of indication which will show at all remote operating positions whether the doors are open or closed. Remote operating positions shall only be at the navigation bridge as required by paragraph 7.1.5 and at the location where hand operation above the bulkhead deck is required by paragraph 7.1.4.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">7.1 Each power-operated sliding watertight door:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 shall have a vertical or horizontal motion;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 shall, subject to paragraph 10, be normally limited to a maximum clear opening width of 1.2 m. The Administration may permit larger doors only to the extent considered necessary for the effective operation of the ship provided that other safety measures, including the following, are taken into consideration:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 special consideration shall be given to the strength of the door and its closing appliances in order to prevent leakages; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 the door shall be located inboard the damage zone B/5;</H6>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.3 shall be fitted with the necessary equipment to open and close the door using electric power, hydraulic power, or any other form of power that is acceptable to the Administration;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.4 shall be provided with an individual hand-operated mechanism. It shall be possible to open and close the door by hand at the door itself from either side, and in addition, close the door from an accessible position above the bulkhead deck with an all round crank motion or some other movement providing the same degree of safety acceptable to the Administration. Direction of rotation or other movement is to be clearly indicated at all operating positions. The time necessary for the complete closure of the door, when operating by hand gear, shall not exceed 90 s with the ship in the upright position;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.5 shall be provided with controls for opening and closing the door by power from both sides of the door and also for closing the door by power from the central operating console at the navigation bridge;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.6 shall be provided with an audible alarm, distinct from any other alarm in the area, which will sound whenever the door is closed remotely by power and which shall sound for at least 5 s but no more than 10 s before the door begins to move and shall continue sounding until the door is completely closed. In the case of remote hand operation it is sufficient for the audible alarm to sound only when the door is moving. Additionally, in passenger areas and areas of high ambient noise the Administration may require the audible alarm to be supplemented by an intermittent visual signal at the door; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.7 shall have an approximately uniform rate of closure under power. The closure time, from the time the door begins to move to the time it reaches the completely closed position shall in no case be less than 20 s or more than 40 s with the ship in the upright position.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">7.2 The electrical power required for power-operated sliding watertight doors shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck. The associated control, indication and alarm circuits shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck and be capable of being automatically supplied by the transitional source of emergency electrical power required by regulation 42.3.1.3 in the event of failure of either the main or emergency source of electrical power.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">7.3 Power-operated sliding watertight doors shall have either:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 a centralized hydraulic system with two independent power sources each consisting of a motor and pump capable of simultaneously closing all doors. In addition, there shall be for the whole installation hydraulic accumulators of sufficient capacity to operate all the doors at least three times, i.e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15º. This operating cycle shall be capable of being carried out when the accumulator is at the pump cut-in pressure. The fluid used shall be chosen considering the temperatures liable to be encountered by the installation during its service. The power operating system shall be designed to minimize the possibility of having a single failure in the hydraulic piping adversely affect the operation of more than one door. The hydraulic system shall be provided with a low-level alarm for hydraulic fluid reservoirs serving the power-operated system and a low gas pressure alarm or other effective means of monitoring loss of stored energy in hydraulic accumulators. These alarms are to be audible and visual and shall be situated on the central operating console at the navigation bridge; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 an independent hydraulic system for each door with each power source consisting of a motor and pump capable of opening and closing the door. In addition, there shall be a hydraulic accumulator of sufficient capacity to operate the door at least three times, i.e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15<SUP>o</SUP>. This operating cycle shall be capable of being carried out when the accumulator is at the pump cut-in pressure. The fluid used shall be chosen considering the temperatures liable to be encountered by the installation during its service. A low gas pressure group alarm or other effective means of monitoring loss of stored energy in hydraulic accumulators shall be provided at the central operating console on the navigation bridge. Loss of stored energy indication at each local operating position shall also be provided; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.3 an independent electrical system and motor for each door with each power source consisting of a motor capable of opening and closing the door. The power source shall be capable of being automatically supplied by the transitional source of emergency electrical power as required by regulation 42.4.2 - in the event of failure of either the main or emergency source of electrical power and with sufficient capacity to operate the door at least three times, i.e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15<SUP>o</SUP>.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">For the systems specified in paragraphs 7.3.1, 7.3.2 and 7.3.3, provision should be made as follows: Power systems for power-operated watertight sliding doors shall be separate from any other power system. A single failure in the electric or hydraulic power-operated systems excluding the hydraulic actuator shall not prevent the hand operation of any door.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">7.4 Control handles shall be provided at each side of the bulkhead at a minimum height of 1.6 m above the floor and shall be so arranged as to enable persons passing through the doorway to hold both handles in the open position without being able to set the power closing mechanism in operation accidentally. The direction of movement of the handles in opening and closing the door shall be in the direction of door movement and shall be clearly indicated.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">7.5 As far as practicable, electrical equipment and components for watertight doors shall be situated above the bulkhead deck and outside hazardous areas and spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">7.6 The enclosures of electrical components necessarily situated below the bulkhead deck shall provide suitable protection against the ingress of water.*</H4>
<H6 class=footnote style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">* Refer to the following publication IEC 60529:2003:</H6>
<H6 class=footnote style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 electrical motors, associated circuits and control components; protected to IPX 7 standard;</H6>
<H6 class=footnote style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 door position indicators and associated circuit components; protected to IPX 8 standard; and</H6>
<H6 class=footnote style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.3 door movement warning si gnals; protected to IPX 6 standard.</H6>
<H6 class=footnote style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Other arrangements for the enclosures of electrical components may be fitted provided the Administration is satisfied that an equivalent protection is achieved. The water pressure IPX 8 shall be based on the pressure that may occur at the location of the component during flooding for a period of 36 h.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">7.7 Electric power, control, indication and alarm circuits shall be protected against fault in such a way that a failure in one door circuit will not cause a failure in any other door circuit. Short circuits or other faults in the alarm or indicator circuits of a door shall not result in a loss of power operation of that door. Arrangements shall be such that leakage of water into the electrical equipment located below the bulkhead deck will not cause the door to open.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">7.8 A single electrical failure in the power operating or control system of a power-operated sliding watertight door shall not result in a closed door opening. Availability of the power supply should be continuously monitored at a point in the electrical circuit as near as practicable to each of the motors required by paragraph 7.3. Loss of any such power supply should activate an audible and visual alarm at the central operating console at the navigation bridge.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">8.1 The central operating console at the navigation bridge shall have a “master mode” switch with two modes of control: a “local control” mode which shall allow any door to be locally opened and locally closed after use without automatic closure, and a “doors closed” mode which shall automatically close any door that is open. The “doors closed” mode shall automatically close any door that is open. The “doors closed” mode shall permit doors to be opened locally and shall automatically re-close the doors upon release of the local control mechanism. The “master mode” switch shall normally be in the “local control” mode. The “doors closed” mode shall only be used in an emergency or for testing purposes. Special consideration shall be given to the reliability of the “master mode” switch.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">8.2 The central operating console at the navigation bridge shall be provided with a diagram showing the location of each door, with visual indicators to show whether each door is open or closed. A red light shall indicate a door is fully open and a green light shall indicate a door is fully closed. When the door is closed remotely the red light shall indicate the intermediate position by flashing. The indicating circuit shall be independent of the control circuit for each door.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">8.3 It shall not be possible to remotely open any door from the central operating console.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">9.1 If the Administration is satisfied that such doors are essential, watertight doors of satisfactory construction may be fitted in watertight bulkheads dividing cargo between deck spaces. Such doors may be hinged, rolling or sliding doors but shall not be remotely controlled. They shall be fitted at the highest level and as far from the shell plating as practicable, but in no case shall the outboard vertical edges be situated at a distance from the shell plating which is less than one fifth of the breadth of the ship, as defined in regulation 2, such distance being measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision draught.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">9.2 Should any such doors be accessible during the voyage, they shall be fitted with a device which prevents unauthorized opening. When it is proposed to fit such doors, the number and arrangements shall receive the special consideration of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">10 Portable plates on bulkheads shall not be permitted except in machinery spaces. The Administration may permit not more than one power-operated sliding watertight door in each watertight bulkhead larger than those specified in paragraph 7.1.2 to be substituted for these portable plates, provided these doors are intended to remain closed during navigation except in case of urgent necessity at the discretion of the master. These doors need not meet the requirements of paragraph 7.1.4 regarding complete closure by hand-operated gear in 90 s.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">11.1 Where trunkways or tunnels for access from crew accommodation to the stokehold, for piping, or for any other purpose are carried through watertight bulkheads, they shall be watertight and in accordance with the requirements of regulation 16-1. The access to at least one end of each such tunnel or trunkway, if used as a passage at sea, shall be through a trunk extending watertight to a height sufficient to permit access above the bulkhead deck. The access to the other end of the trunkway or tunnel may be through a watertight door of the type required by its location in the ship. Such trunkways or tunnels shall not extend through the first subdivision bulkhead abaft the collision bulkhead.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">11.2 Where it is proposed to fit tunnels piercing watertight bulkheads, these shall receive the special consideration of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">11.3 Where trunkways in connection with refrigerated cargo and ventilation or forced draught trunks are carried through more than one watertight bulkhead, the means of closure at such openings shall be operated by power and be capable of being closed from a central position situated above the bulkhead deck.</H4></BODY></HTML>
