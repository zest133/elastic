<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 56</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Location and separation of spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Machinery spaces shall be positioned aft of cargo tanks and slop tanks; they shall also be situated aft of cargo pump rooms and cofferdams, but not necessarily aft of the oil fuel bunker tanks. Any machinery space shall be isolated from cargo tanks and slop tanks by cofferdams, cargo pump rooms, oil fuel bunker tanks or permanent ballast tanks. Pump rooms containing pumps and their accessories for ballasting those spaces situated adjacent to cargo tanks and slop tanks and pumps for oil fuel transfer shall be considered as equivalent to a cargo pump within the context of this regulation, provided that such pump rooms have the same safety standard as that required for cargo pump rooms. However, the lower portion of the pump room may be recessed into machinery spaces of category A to accommodate pumps, provided that the deck head of the recess is in general not more than one third of the moulded depth above the keel, except that in the case of ships of not more than 25,000 tonnes deadweight, where it can be demonstrated that for reasons of access and satisfactory piping arrangements that is impracticable, the Administration may permit a recess in excess of such height, but not exceeding one half of the moulded depth above the keel.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Accommodation spaces, main cargo control stations, control stations and service spaces (excluding isolated cargo handling gear lockers) shall be positioned aft of all cargo tanks, slop tanks, cargo pump rooms and cofferdams which isolate cargo or slop tanks from machinery spaces, but not necessarily aft of the oil fuel bunker tanks. A recess provided in accordance with paragraph 1 need not be taken into account when the position of these spaces is being determined.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 However, where deemed necessary, accommodation spaces, control stations, machinery spaces other than those of category A, and service spaces may be permitted forward of the cargo area, provided they are isolated from the cargo tanks and slop tanks by cofferdams, cargo pump rooms, oil fuel bunker tanks or permanent ballast tanks and subject to an equivalent standard of safety and appropriate availability of fire-extinguishing arrangements being provided to the satisfaction of the Administration. In addition, where deemed necessary for the safety of navigation of the ship, the Administration may permit machinery spaces containing internal combustion machinery not being main propulsion machinery having an output greater than 375Kw to be located forward of the cargo area provided the arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 In combination carriers only:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 The slop tanks are to be surrounded by cofferdams except where the boundaries of the slop tanks where slop may be carried on dry cargo voyages are the hull, main cargo deck, cargo pump room bulkhead or oil fuel bunker tank. These cofferdams shall not be open to a double bottom, pipe tunnel, pump room or other enclosed space. Means shall be provided for filling the cofferdams with water and for draining them. Where the boundary of a slop tank is the cargo pump room bulkhead the pump room shall not be open to the double bottom, pipe tunnel or other enclosed space, however, openings provided with gastight bolted covers may be permitted.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 Means shall be provided for isolating the piping connecting the pump room with the slop tanks referred to in paragraph 4.1. The means of isolation shall consist of a valve followed by a spectacle flange or a spool piece with appropriate blank flanges. This arrangement shall be located adjacent to the slop tanks, but where this is unreasonable or impracticable it may be located within the pump room directly after the piping penetrates the bulkhead. A separate pumping and piping arrangement shall be provided for discharging the contents of the slop tanks directly over the open deck when the ship is in the dry cargo mode.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 Hatches and tank cleaning openings to slop tanks shall only be permitted on the open deck and shall be fitted with closing arrangements. Except where they consist of bolted plates with bolts at watertight spacing, these closing arrangements shall be provided with locking arrangements which shall be under the control of the responsible ship's officer.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 Where cargo wing tanks are provided, cargo oil lines below deck shall be installed inside these tanks. However, the Administration may permit cargo oil lines to be placed in special ducts which shall be capable of being adequately cleaned and ventilated and be to the satisfaction of the Administration. Where cargo wing tanks are not provided cargo oil lines below deck shall be placed in special ducts.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Where the fitting of a navigation position above the cargo tank area is shown to be necessary, it shall be for navigation purposes only and it shall be separated from the cargo tank deck by means of an open space with a height of at least 2 m. The fire protection of such a navigation position shall in addition be as required for control spaces in Regulation 58.1 and 58.2 and other provisions, as applicable, of this part.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Means shall be provided to keep deck spills away from the accommodation and service areas. This may be accomplished by provision of a permanent continuous coaming of a suitable height extending from side to side. Special consideration shall be given to the arrangements associated with stern loading.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Exterior boundaries of superstructures and deckhouses enclosing accommodation and including any overhanging decks which support such accommodation, shall be insulated to "A-60" standard for the whole of the portions which face cargo area and for 3 m aft of the front boundary. In the case of the sides of those superstructures and deckhouses, such insulation shall be carried as high as is deemed necessary by the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8.1 Entrances, air inlets and openings to accommodation spaces, service spaces and control stations shall not face the cargo area. They shall be located on the transverse bulkhead not facing the cargo area or on the outboard side of the superstructure or deckhouse at a distance of at least 4% of the length of the ship but not less than 3 m from the end of the superstructure or deckhouse facing the cargo area. This distance, however, need not exceed 5 m.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8.2 No doors shall be fitted within the limits mentioned in paragraph 8.1, except that doors to spaces not having access to accommodation spaces, service spaces and control stations, may be permitted by the Administration. Such spaces may be cargo control stations, provision rooms and store-rooms. Where such doors are fitted, to spaces located aft of the cargo area, the boundaries of the space shall be insulated to "A-60" standard, with the exception of the boundary facing the cargo area. Bolted plates for removal of machinery may be fitted within the limits specified in paragraph 8.1. Wheelhouse doors and wheelhouse windows may be located within the limits specified in paragraph 8.1 so long as they are designed to ensure that the wheelhouse can be made rapidly and efficiently gas and vapour tight.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8.3 Windows and sidescuttles facing the cargo area and on the sides of the superstructures and deckhouses within the limits specified in paragraph 8.1 shall be of the fixed (non-opening) type. Such windows and sidescuttles in the first tier on the main deck shall be fitted with inside covers of steel or other equivalent material.</H4></BODY></HTML>
