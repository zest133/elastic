<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11 Portable plates on bulkheads shall not be permitted except in machinery spaces. Such plates shall always be in place before the ship leaves port, and shall not be removed during navigation except in case of urgent necessity at the discretion of the master. The times of removal and replacement of any such portable plates shall be recorded in the log-book, and the necessary precautions shall be taken in replacing them to ensure that the joints are watertight. The Administration may permit not more than one power-operated sliding watertight door in each main transverse bulkhead larger than those specified in paragraph 7.1.2 to be substituted for these portable plates, provided these doors are closed before the ship leaves port and remain closed during navigation except in case of urgent necessity at the discretion of the master. These doors need not meet the requirements of paragraph 7.1.4 regarding complete closure by hand-operated gear in 90s. The time of opening and closing these doors, whether the ship is at sea or in port, shall be recorded in the log-book.</H4>
