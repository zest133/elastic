<H6 class=body2 align=justify>3.2.1 General </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>3.2.1.1 In passenger ships, "A", "B" or "C" class divisions in accommodation and services spaces which are faced with combustible materials, facings, mouldings, decorations and veneers shall comply with the provisions of paragraphs 3.2.2 to 3.2.4 and regulation 6. However, traditional wooden benches and wooden linings on bulkheads and ceilings are permitted in saunas and such materials need not be subject to the calculations prescribed in paragraphs 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>3.2.1.2 In cargo ships, non-combustible bulkheads, ceilings and linings fitted in accommodation and service spaces may be faced with combustible materials, facings, mouldings, decorations and veneers provided such spaces are bounded by non-combustible bulkheads, ceilings and linings in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3.2.2 to 3.2.4 and regulation 6. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>3.2.2 Maximum calorific value of combustible materials </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>Combustible materials used on the surfaces and linings specified in paragraph 3.2.1 shall have a calorific value * not exceeding 45 MJ/mÂ² of the area for the thickness used. The requirements of this paragraph are not applicable to the surfaces of furniture fixed to linings or bulkheads. </H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the recommendations published by the International Organization for Standardization, in particular,Publication ISO 1716:2002 on Determination of calorific potential. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>3.2.3 Total volume of combustible materials </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>Where combustible materials are used in accordance with paragraph 3.2.1, they shall comply with the following requirements: </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1 The total volume of combustible facings, mouldings, decorations and veneers in accommodation and service spaces shall not exceed a volume equivalent to 2.5 mm veneer on the combined area of the walls and ceiling linings. Furniture fixed to linings, bulkheads or decks need not be included in the calculation of the total volume of combustible materials; and </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2 In the case of ships fitted with an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of the Fire Safety Systems Code, the above volume may include some combustible material used for erection of "C" class divisions. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>3.2.4 Low flame-spread characteristics of exposed surfaces </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>The following surfaces shall have low flame-spread characteristics in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code: </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>3.2.4.1 In passenger ships: </H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify>.1 exposed surfaces in corridors and stairway enclosures and of bulkhead and ceiling linings in accommodation and service spaces (except saunas) and control stations; and </H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify>.2 surfaces and grounds in concealed or inaccessible spaces in accommodation and service spaces and control stations. </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>3.2.4.2 In cargo ships: </H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify>.1 exposed surfaces in corridors and stairway enclosures and of ceilings in accommodation and service spaces (except saunas) and control stations; and </H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify>.2 surfaces and grounds in concealed or inaccessible spaces in accommodation and service spaces and control stations. </H6></BODY></HTML>
