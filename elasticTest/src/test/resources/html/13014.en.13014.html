<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Thermal performance requirements for immersion suits</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 An immersion suit made of material which has no inherent insulation shall be:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 marked with instructions that it must be worn in conjunction with warm clothing;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 so constructed that, when worn in conjunction with warm clothing, and with a lifejacket if the immersion suit is to be worn with a lifejacket, the immersion suit continues to provide sufficient thermal protection, following one jump by the wearer into the water from a height of 4.5 m, to ensure that when it is worn for a period of 1 h in calm circulating water at a temperature of 5°C the wearer's body core temperature does not fall more than 2°C.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 An immersion suit made of material with inherent insulation, when worn either on its own or with a lifejacket, if the immersion suit is to be worn in conjunction with a lifejacket, shall provide the wearer with sufficient thermal insulation, following one jump into the water from a height of 4.5 m, to ensure that the wearer's body core temperature does not fall more than 2°C after a period of 6 h immersion in calm circulating water at a temperature of between 0°C and 2°C.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3 The immersion suit shall permit the person wearing it with hands covered to pick up a pencil and write after being immersed in water at 5°C for a period of 1 h.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Buoyancy requirements</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>A person in fresh water wearing either an immersion suit complying with the requirements of regulation 32, or an immersion suit with a lifejacket, shall be able to turn from a face-down to a face-up position in not more than 5 s.</H5></BODY></HTML>
