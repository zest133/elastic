<H3 class=regulation align=center>Definitions</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>For the purpose of this Chapter, unless expressly provided otherwise:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(a)</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(i) A subdivision load line is a water-line used in determining the subdivision of the ship.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(ii) The deepest subdivision load line is the water-line which corresponds to the greatest draught permitted by the subdivision requirements which are applicable.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(b) The length of the ship is the length measured between perpendiculars taken at the extremities of the deepest subdivision load line.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(c) The breadth of the ship is the extreme width from outside of frame to outside of frame at or below the deepest subdivision load line.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(d) The draught is the vertical distance from the moulded base line amidships to the subdivision load line in question.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(e) The bulkhead deck is the uppermost deck up to which the transverse watertight bulkheads are carried.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(f) The margin line is a line drawn at least 76 millimetres (3 inches) below the upper surface of the bulkhead deck at side.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(g) The permeability of a space is the percentage of that space which can be occupied by water. The volume of a space which extends above the margin line shall be measured only to the height of that line.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(h) The machinery space is to be taken as extending from the moulded base line to the marginline and between the extreme main transverse watertight bulkheads bounding the spaces containing the main and auxiliary propelling machinery, boilers serving the needs of propulsion, and all permanent coal bunkers. In the case of unusual arrangements, the Administration may define the limits of the machinery spaces.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Passenger spaces are those which are provided for the accommodation and use of passengers, excluding baggage, store, provision and mail rooms. For the purposes of Regulations 4 and 5 of this Chapter, spaces provided below the margin line for the accommodation and use of the crew shall be regarded as passenger spaces.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(j) In all cases volumes and areas shall be calculated to moulded lines.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(k) The remote steering gear control system is the means by which required rudder movements are transmitted from the navigating bridge to the steering gear power unit controls.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(l) The main steering gear is the machinery, the steering gear power units, if any, and ancillary equipment and the means of applying torque to the rudder stock (e.g. tiller or quadrant) necessary for effecting movement of the rudder for the purpose of steering the ship under normal service conditions.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(m) The steering gear power unit is:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(i) In the case of electric steering gear, an electric motor and its associated electrical equipment;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(ii) in the case of electro-hydraulic steering gear, an electric motor and its associated electrical equipment and connected pump;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(iii) in the case of other hydraulic steering gear, a driving engine and connected pump.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(n) The auxiliary steering gear is that equipment which is provided for effecting movement of the rudder for the purpose of steering the ship in the event of failure of the main steering gear.</H5></BODY></HTML>
