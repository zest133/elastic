<H3 class=regulation align=center>Double bottoms in passenger ships</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 A double bottom shall be fitted extending from the forepeak bulkhead to the afterpeak bulkhead as far as this is practicable and compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 In ships of 50 m and upwards but less than 61 m in length a double bottom shall be fitted at least from the machinery space to the forepeak bulkhead, or as near thereto as practicable.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 In ships of 61 m and upwards but less than 76 m in length a double bottom shall be fitted at least outside the machinery space, and shall extend to the fore and after peak bulkheads, or as near thereto as practicable.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 In ships of 76 m in length and upwards, a double bottom shall be fitted amidships, and shall extend to the fore and after peak bulkheads, or as near thereto as practicable.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Where a double bottom is required to be fitted its depth shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration and the inner bottom shall be continued out to the ship's sides in such a manner as to protect the bottom to the turn of the bilge. Such protection will be deemed satisfactory if the line of intersection of the outer edge of the margin plate with the bilge plating is not lower at any part than a horizontal plane passing through the point of intersection with the frame line amidships of a transverse diagonal line inclined at 25Â° to the base line and cutting it at a point one-half the ship's moulded breadth from the middle line.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Small wells constructed in the double bottom in connection with drainage arrangements of holds, etc., shall not extend down wards more than necessary. The depth of the well shall in no case be more than the depth less 460 mm of the double bottom at the centre line, nor shall the well extend below the horizontal plane referred to in paragraph 2. A well extending to the outer bottom is, however, permitted at the after end of the shaft tunnel. Other wells (e.g.,for lubricating oil under main engines) may be permitted by the Administration if satisfied that the arrangements give protection equivalent to that afforded by a double bottom complying with this Regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 A double bottom need not be fitted in way of watertight compartments of moderate size used exclusively for the carriage of liquids, provided the safety of the ship, in the event of bottom or side damage, is not, in the opinion of the Administration, thereby impaired.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 In the case of ships to which the provisions of Regulation 1.5 apply and which are engaged on regular service within the limits of a short international voyage as defined in Regulation III/2, the Administration may permit a double bottom to be dispensed with in any part of the ship which is subdivided by a factor not exceeding .50, if satisfied that the fitting of a double bottom in that part would not be compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.</H4>
