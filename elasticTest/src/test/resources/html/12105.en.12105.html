<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fixed high -expansion foam fire-extinguishing systems in machinery spaces*</H3>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12631&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.670</A>, Guidelines for the performance and testing criteria and surveyors of high-expansion foam concentrates for fixed fire-extinguishing system.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.1 Any required fixed high-expansion foam system in machinery spaces shall be capable of rapidly discharging through fixed discharge outlets a quantity of foam sufficient to fill the greatest space to be protected at a rate of at least 1 m in depth per minute. The quantity of foam-forming liquid available shall be sufficient to produce a volume of foam equal to five times the volume of the largest space to be protected. The expansion ratio of the foam shall not exceed 1,000 to 1.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.2 The Administration may permit alternative arrangements and discharge rates provided that it is satisfied that equivalent protection is achieved.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Supply ducts for delivering foam, air intakes to the foam generator and the number of foam-producing units shall in the opinion of the Administration be such as will provide effective foam production and distribution.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 The arrangement of the foam generator delivery ducting shall be such that a fire in the protected space will not affect the foam generating equipment.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 The foam generator, its sources of power supply, foam-forming liquid and means of controlling the system shall be readily accessible and simple to operate and shall be grouped in as few locations as possible at positions not likely to be cut off by a fire in the protected space.</H4></BODY></HTML>
