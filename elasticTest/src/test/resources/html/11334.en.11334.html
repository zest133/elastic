<H3 class=regulation align=center>(C) COMPARTMENTS LOADED IN COMBINATION</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>The following paragraphs describe the pattern of void behaviour which shall be assumed when compartments are loaded in combination:</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Without effective centreline divisions:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Under the upper deck - as for the single deck arrangement described in Section II(B) of this Part.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Under the second deck - the area of void available for transfer from the low side, i.e. original void area less area against the hatch side girder, shall be assumed to transfer as follows: one half to the upper deck hatchway and one quarter each to the high side under the upper and second deck.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) Under the third and lower decks - the void areas available for transfer from the low side of each of these decks shall be assumed to transfer in equal quantities to all the voids under the decks on the high side and the void in the upper deck hatchway.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) With effective centreline divisions which extend into the upper deck hatchway:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) At all deck levels abreast the division the void areas available for transfer from the low side shall be assumed to transfer to the void under the low side half of the upper deck hatchway.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) At the deck level immediately below the bottom of the division the void area available for transfer from the low side shall be assumed to transfer as follows: one half to the void under the low side half of the upper deck hatchway and the remainder in equal quantities to the voids under the decks on the high side.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) At deck levels lower than those described in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph the void area available for transfer from the low side of each of those decks shall be assumed to transfer in equal quantities to the voids in each of the two halves of the upper deck hatchway on each side of the division and the voids under the decks on the high side.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) With effective centreline divisions which do not extend into the upper deck hatchway:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Since no horizontal transfer of voids may be assumed to take place at the same deck level as the division the void area available for transfer from the low side at this level shall be assumed to transfer above the division to voids on the high sides in accordance with the principles of paragraphs (a) and (b) above.</H5>
