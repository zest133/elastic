<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Every ship shall be provided with:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 a VHF radio installation capable of transmitting and receiving:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.1 DSC* on the frequency 156.525MHz (channel 70). It shall be possible to initiate the transmission of distress alerts on channel 70 from the position from which the ship is normally navigated;** and</H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Digital selective calling (DSC) for all ships and HF direct-printing telegraphy (NBDP) carriage requirements for ships of 300 tons gross tonnage are subject to review in accordance with resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7147&amp;localekey=en">A.606(15)</A> - Review and evaluation of the GMDSS. Unless otherwise specified this footnote applies to all DSC and NBDP requirements prescribed in the Convention.</H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>** Certain ships may be exempted from this requirement(see regulation 9.4).</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.2 radiotelephony on the frequencies 156.300MHz (channel 6), 156.650MHz (channel 13) and 156.800MHz (channel 16);</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 a radio installation capable of maintaining a continuous DSC watch on VHF channel 70 which may be separate from, or combined with, that required by subparagraph .1.1;**</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Certain ships may be exempted from this requirement(see regulation 9.4).</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 a radar transponder capable of operating in the 9 GHz band, which:</H5>

<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 a radio facility for reception of maritime safety information by the INMARSAT enhanced group calling system if the ship is engaged on voyages in any area of INMARSAT coverage but in which an international NAVTEX service is not provided. However, ships engaged exclusively on voyages in areas where all HF direct-printing telegraphy* maritime safety information service is provided and fitted with equipment capable of receiving such service, may be exempt from this requirement.**</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Digital selective calling (DSC) for all ships and HF direct-printing telegraphy (NBDP) carriage requirements for ships of 300 tons gross tonnage and over but less than 1,600 tons gross tonnage are subject to review in accordance with resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7147&amp;localekey=en">A.606(15)</A> - Review and evaluation of the GMDSS. Unless otherwise specified this footnote applies to all DSC and NBDP requirements prescribed in the Convention.</H6>

<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6.1 capable of transmitting a distress alert either through the polar orbiting satellite service operating in the 406MHz band or, if the ship is engaged only on voyages within INMARSAT coverage, through the INMARSAT geostationary satellite service operating in the 1.6GHz band;***</H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>*** Subject to the availability of appropriate receiving and processing ground facilities for each ocean region covered by INMARSAT satellites.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6.2 installed in an easily accessible position;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6.3 ready to be manually released and capable of being carried by one person into a survival craft;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6.4 capable of floating free if the ship sinks and of being automatically activated when afloat; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6.5 capable of being activated manually.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Until 1 February 1999 or until such other date as may be determined by the Maritime Safety Committee, every ship shall, in addition, be fitted with a radio installation consisting of a radiotelephone distress frequency watch receiver capable of operating on 2,182kHz .</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Until 1 February 1999, every ship shall, unless the ship is engaged on voyages in sea area A1 only, be fitted with a device for generating the radiotelephone alarm signal on the frequency 2,182kHz .</H4>
