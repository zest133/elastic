<H3 class=regulation align=center>Assigning, marking and recording of subdivision load lines for passenger ships</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 In order that the required degree of subdivision shall be maintained, a load line corresponding to the approved subdivision draught shall be assigned and marked on the ship's sides. A ship having spaces which are specially adapted for the accommodation of passengers and the carriage of cargo alternatively may, if the owners desire, have one or more additional load lines assigned and marked to correspond with the subdivision draughts which the Administration may approve for the alternative service conditions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The subdivision load lines assigned and marked shall be recorded in the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate, and shall be distinguished by the notation C.1 for the principal passenger condition, and C.2, C.3, etc. for the alternative conditions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 The freeboard corresponding to each of these load lines shall be measured at the same position and from the same deck line as the freeboards determined in accordance with the International Convention on Load Lines in force.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 The freeboard corresponding to each approved subdivision load line and the conditions of service for which it is approved, shall be clearly indicated on the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 In no case shall any subdivision load line mark be placed above the deepest load line in salt water as determined by the strength of the ship or the International Convention on Load Lines in force.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Whatever may be the position of the subdivision load line marks, a ship shall in no case be loaded so as to submerge the load line mark appropriate to the season and locality as determined in accordance with the International Convention on Load Lines in force.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 A ship shall in no case be so loaded that when it is in salt water the subdivision load line mark appropriate to the particular voyage and condition of service is submerged.</H4></BODY></HTML>
