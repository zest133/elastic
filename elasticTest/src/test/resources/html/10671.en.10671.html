<H3 class=regulation align=center>Trimming of Grain</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>All necessary and reasonable trimming shall be performed to level all free grain surfaces and to minimize the effect of grain shifting.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(a) In any "filled compartment", the bulk grain shall be trimmed so as to fill all the spaces under the decks and hatch covers to the maximum extent possible.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(b) After loading, all free grain surfaces in "partly filled compartments" shall be level.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(c) The Administration issuing the document of authorization may, under Regulation 9 of this Chapter, grant dispensation from trimming in those cases where the underdeck void geometry resulting from free flowing grain into a compartment, which may be provided with feeding ducts, perforated decks or other similar means, is taken into account to its satisfaction when calculating the void depths.</H5></BODY></HTML>
