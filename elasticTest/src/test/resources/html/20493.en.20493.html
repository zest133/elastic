<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Cargo tank venting</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 The venting systems of cargo tanks are to be entirely distinct from the air pipes of the other compartments of the ship. The arrangements and position of openings in the cargo tank deck from which emission of flammable vapours can occur shall be such as to minimize the possibility of flammable vapours being admitted to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition, or collecting in the vicinity of deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard. In accordance with this general principle the criteria in paragraphs 1.2 to 1.10 will apply.</H5>
