<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11.3 Means shall be provided to protect cargo tanks against the effect of overpressure or vacuum caused by thermal variations when the cargo tanks are isolated from the inert gas mains.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11.4 Piping systems shall be so designed as to prevent the accumulation of cargo or water in the pipelines under all normal conditions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11.5 Suitable arrangements shall be provided to enable the inert gas main to be connected to an external supply of inert gas.</H4>
