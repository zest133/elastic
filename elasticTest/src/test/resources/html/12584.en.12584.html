<H3 class=regulation align=center>VHF radiotelephone installation</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The VHF radiotelephone installation shall be in the upper part of the ship complying with the provisions of this regulation and comprising a transmitter and receiver, a source of energy capable of actuating them at their rated power levels, and an antenna suitable for efficient radiating and receiving signals at the operating frequencies.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) On board passenger ships irrespective of size and cargo ships of 500 tons gross tonnage and upwards it shall be possible to operate the VHF radiotelephone installation from a source of energy which is situated in the upper part of the ship and has sufficient capacity for at least six hours of operation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The Administration may authorize the use of the reserve source of energy of the radiotelegraph installation or the radiotelephone installation respectively referred to in regulation 10(m) and regulation 16(j) to supply the VHF radiotelephone installation. In this case the reserve source of energy is required to be of a capacity sufficient to operate simultaneously the VHF radiotelephone installation and:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) the reserve radiotelegraph transmitter and receiver for at least six hours unless a switching device is fitted to ensure alternate operation only; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) the radiotelephone transmitter and receiver for at least six hours unless a switching device is fitted to ensure alternate operation only.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The VHF radiotelephone installation shall conform to the requirements laid down in the Radio Regulations for equipment used in the VHF maritime mobile radiotelephone service and shall be capable of operation on those channels specified by the Radio Regulations and as may be required by the Contracting Government referred to in regulation 4-1(b).</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) The Contracting Government referred to in regulation 4-1(b) shall not require the transmitter R.F. carrier power output to be greater than 10 watts. The antenna shall, in so far as is practicable, have an unobstructed view in all directions.*</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* For guidance purposes, it is assumed that each ship is fitted with a vertically polarized unity gain antenna at a nominal height of 9.15 m above water, a transmitter R. F. power output of 10 watts, and a receiver sensitivity of 2 microvolts across the input terminals for 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) Control of the channels required for navigational safety shall be immediately available on the navigating bridge convenient to the conning position and, where necessary, facilities should be available to permit radiocommunications from the wings of the navigating bridge.</H4></BODY></HTML>
