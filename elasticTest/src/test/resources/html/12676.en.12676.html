<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Manually operated call points complying with the requirements of regulation 13 shall be installed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 A fixed fire detection and fire alarm system of an approved type shall be provided.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 All ships shall at all times when at sea, or in port (except when out of service), be so manned or equipped as to ensure that any initial fire alarm is immediately received by a responsible member of the crew.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 A special alarm, operated from the navigating bridge or fire control station, shall be fitted to summon the crew. This alarm may be part of the ship's general alarm system but it shall be capable of being sounded independently of the alarm to the passenger spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 A public address system or other effective means of communication shall be available throughout the accommodation and service spaces and control stations.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 For ships carrying more than 36 passengers an efficient patrol system shall be maintained so that an outbreak of fire may be promptly detected. Each member of the fire patrol shall be trained to be familiar with the arrangements of the ship as well as the location and operation of any equipment he may be called upon to use.</H4></BODY></HTML>
