<H3 class=regulation align=center>Lifebuoys</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Lifebuoy specification</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Every lifebuoy shall:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 have an outer diameter of not more than 800mm and an inner diameter of not less than 400mm;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 be constructed of inherently buoyant material; it shall not depend upon rushes, cork shavings or granulated cork, any other loose granulated material or any air compartment which depends on inflation for buoyancy;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 be capable of supporting not less than 14.5kg of iron in fresh water for a period of 24 hr;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 have a mass of not less than 2.5kg ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 not sustain burning or continue melting after being totally enveloped in a fire for a period of 2 s;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 be constructed to withstand a drop into the water from the height at which it is stowed above the waterline in the lightest seagoing condition or 30 m, whichever is the greater, without impairing either its operating capability or that of its attached components;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.7 if it is intended to operate the quick-release arrangement provided for the self-activated smoke signals and self-igniting lights, have a mass sufficient to operate the quick-release arrangement or 4kg, whichever is the greater;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.8 be fitted with a grabline not less than 9.5mm in diameter and not less than 4 times the outside diameter of the body of the buoy in length. The grabline shall be secured at four equidistant points around the circumference of the buoy to form four equal loops.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Lifebuoy self-igniting lights</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Self-igniting lights required by regulation 7.1.3 shall:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 be such that they cannot be extinguished by water;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 be capable of either burning continuously with a luminous intensity of not less than 2 cd in all directions of the upper hemisphere or flashing (discharge flashing) at a rate of not less than 50 flashes per minute with at least the corresponding effective luminous intensity;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 be provided with a source of energy capable of meeting the requirement of paragraph 2.2 for a period of at least 2 hr;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 be capable of withstanding the drop test required by paragraph 1.6.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Lifebuoy self-activating smoke signals</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Self-activating smoke signals required by regulation 7.1.3 shall:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 emit smoke of a highly visible colour at a uniform rate for a period of at least 15 min when floating in calm water;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 not ignite explosively or emit any flame during the entire smoke emission time of the signal;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 not be swamped in a seaway;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 continue to emit smoke when fully submerged in water for a period of at least 10 s;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 be capable of withstanding the drop test required by paragraph 1.6.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Buoyant lifelines</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Buoyant lifelines required by regulation 7.1.2 shall:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 be non-kinking;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 have a diameter of not less than 8mm;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 have a breaking strength of not less than 5 kN.</H5></BODY></HTML>
