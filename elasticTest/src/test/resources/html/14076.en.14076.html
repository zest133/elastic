<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(a) For the purpose of this regulation "constructed" in respect of a ship means a stage of construction where:</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) the keel is laid; or</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) construction identifiable with a specific ship begins; or</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(iii) assembly of that ship has commenced comprising at least 50 tonnes or 1 per cent of the estimated mass of all structural material, whichever is less.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(b)</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) Ships of 150 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall be fitted with:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(1) a standard magnetic compass, except as provided in sub-paragraph (iv);</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(2) a steering magnetic compass, unless heading information provided by the standard compass required under (1) is made available and is clearly readable by the helmsman at the main steering position;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(3) adequate means of communication between the standard compass position and the normal navigation control position to the satisfaction of the Administration; and</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(4) means for taking bearings as nearly as practicable over an arc of the horizon of 360 degrees.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) Each magnetic compass referred to in sub-paragraph (i) shall be properly adjusted and its table or curve of residual deviations shall be available at all times.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(iii) A spare magnetic compass, interchangeable with the standard compass, shall be carried, unless the steering compass mentioned in sub-paragraph (i)(2) or a gyro compass is fitted.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(iv) The Administration, if it considers it unreasonable or unnecessary to require a standard magnetic compass, may exempt individual ships or classes of ships from these requirements if the nature of the voyage, the ship's proximity to land or the type of ship does not warrant standard compass, provided that a suitable steering compass is in all cases carried.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(c) Ships of less than 150 tons gross tonnage shall, as far as the Administration considers it reasonable and practicable, be fitted with a steering compass and have means for taking bearings.</H4>

<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(t) If the application of the requirements of this Regulation necessitates structural alterations to a ship constructed before 1 September 1984, the Administration may allow extension of the time limit for fitting the required equipment not later than 1 September 1989, taking into account the first scheduled dry-docking of such a ship required by the present Regulations.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(u) Except as provided elsewhere in this Regulation, the Administration may grant to individual ships exemptions of a partial or conditional nature, when any such ship is engaged on a voyage where the maximum distance of the ship from the shore, the length and nature of the voyage, the absence of general navigation hazards, and other conditions affecting safety are such as to render the full application of this regulation unreasonable or unnecessary. When deciding whether or not to grant exemptions to an individual ship, the Administration shall have regard to the effect that an exemption may have upon the safety of all other ships.</H4></BODY></HTML>
