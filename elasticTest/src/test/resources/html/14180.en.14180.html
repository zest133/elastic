<H3 class=regulation align=center>Precautions against shock, fire and other hazards of electrical origin</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.1 Exposed metal parts of electrical machines or equipment which are not intended to be live but which are liable under fault conditions to become live shall be earthed unless the machines or equipment are:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 supplied at a voltage not exceeding 55 V direct current or 55 V, root mean square between conductors; auto-transformers shall not be used for the purpose of achieving this voltage; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 supplied at a voltage not exceeding 250 V by safety isolating transformers supplying only one consuming device; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 constructed in accordance with the principle of double insulation.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.2 The Administration may require additional precautions for portable electrical equipment for use in confined or exceptionally damp spaces where particular risks due to conductivity may exist.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.3 All electrical apparatus shall be so constructed and so installed as not to cause injury when handled or touched in the normal manner.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Main and emergency switchboards shall be so arranged as to give easy access as may be needed to apparatus and equipment, without danger to personnel. The sides and the rear and, where necessary, the front of the switchboards shall be suitably guarded. Exposed live parts having voltages to earth exceeding a voltage to be specified by the Administration shall not be installed on the front of such switchboards. Where necessary, non-conducting mats or gratings shall be provided at the front and rear of the switchboard.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.1 The hull return system of distribution shall not be used for any purpose in a tanker, or for power, heating, or lighting in any other ship of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.2 The requirement of paragraph 3.1 does not preclude under conditions approved by the Administration the use of:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 impressed current cathodic protective systems;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 limited and locally earthed systems; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 insulation level monitoring devices provided the circulation current does not exceed 30 mA under the most unfavourable conditions.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.3 Where the hull return system is used, all final subcircuits, i.e. all circuits fitted after the last protective device, shall be two-wire and special precautions shall be taken to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4.1 Earthed distribution systems shall not be used in a tanker. The Administration may exceptionally permit in a tanker the earthing of the neutral for alternating current power networks of 3,000 V(line to line) and over, provided that any possible resulting current does not flow directly through any of the dangerous spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4.2 When a distribution system, whether primary or secondary, for power, heating or lighting, with no connection to earth is used, a device capable of continuously monitoring the insulation level to earth and of giving an audible or visual indication of abnormally low insulation values shall be provided.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.1 Except as permitted by the Administration in exceptional circumstances, all metal sheaths and armour of cables shall be electrically continuous and shall be earthed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.2 All electric cables and wiring external to equipment shall be at least of a flame retardant type and shall be so installed as not to impair their original flame retarding properties. Where necessary for particular applications the Administration may permit the use of special types of cables such as radio frequency cables, which do not comply with the foregoing.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.3 Cables and wiring servicing essential or emergency power, lighting, internal communications or signals shall so far as practicable be routed clear of galleys, laundries, machinery spaces of category A and their casings and other high fire risk areas. Cables connecting fire pumps to the emergency switchboard shall be of a fire resistant type where they pass through high fire risk areas. Where practicable all such cables should be run in such a manner as to preclude their being rendered unserviceable by heating of the bulkheads that may be caused by a fire in an adjacent space.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.4 Where cables which are installed in hazardous areas introduce the risk of fire or explosion in the event of an electrical fault in such areas, special precautions against such risks shall be taken to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.5 Cables and wiring shall be installed and supported in such a manner as to avoid chafing or other damage.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.6 Terminations and joints in all conductors shall be so made as to retain the original electrical, mechanical, flame retarding and, where necessary, fire resisting properties of the cable.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.1 Each separate circuit shall be protected against short circuit and against overload, except as permitted in Regulations 29 and 30 or where the Administration may exceptionally otherwise permit.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.2 The rating or appropriate setting of the overload protective device for each circuit shall be permanently indicated at the location of the protective device.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Lighting fittings shall be so arranged as to prevent temperature rises which could damage the cables and wiring, and to prevent surrounding material from becoming excessively hot.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 All lighting and power circuits terminating in a bunker or cargo space shall be provided with a multiple pole switch outside the space for disconnecting such circuits.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.1 Accumulator batteries shall be suitably housed, and compartments used primarily for their accommodation shall be properly constructed and efficiently ventilated.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.2 Electrical or other equipment which may constitute a source of ignition of flammable vapours shall not be permitted in these compartments except as permitted in paragraph 10.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.3 Accumulator batteries shall not be located in sleeping quarters except where hermetically sealed to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10 No electrical equipment shall be installed in any space where flammable mixtures are liable to collect including those on board tankers or in compartments assigned principally to accumulator batteries, in paint lockers, acetylene stores or similar spaces, unless the Administration is satisfied that such equipment is:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 essential for operational purposes;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 of a type which will not ignite the mixture concerned;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 appropriate to the space concerned; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 appropriately certified for safe usage in the dusts, vapours or gasses likely to be encountered.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11 In a passenger ship, distribution systems shall be so arranged that fire in any main vertical zone as is defined in Regulation II-2/3.9 will not interfere with services essential for safety in any other such zone. This requirement will be met if main and emergency feeders passing through any such zone are separated both vertically and horizontally as widely as is practicable.</H4>
