<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Regulation 53</H3>
<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Special requirements for machinery, boiler and electrical installations</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>1 The special requirements for the machinery, boiler and electrical installations shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration and shall include at least the requirements of this Regulation.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 The main source of electrical power shall comply with the following:</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.1 Where the electrical power can normally be supplied by one generator, suitable load shedding arrangements shall be provided to ensure the integrity of supplies to services required for propulsion and steering as well as the safety of the ship. In the case of loss of the generator in operation, adequate provisions shall be made for automatic starting and connecting to the main switchboard of a stand-by generator of sufficient capacity to permit propulsion and steering and to ensure the safety of the ship with automatic re-starting of the essential auxiliaries including, where necessary, sequential operations. The Administration may dispense with this requirement for a ship of less than 1,600 tons gross tonnage, if it is considered impracticable.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.2 If the electrical power is normally supplied by more than one generator simultaneously in parallel operation, provision shall be made, for instance by load shedding, to ensure that, in case of loss of one of these generating sets, the remaining ones are kept in operation without overload to permit propulsion and steering, and to ensure the safety of the ship.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 Where stand-by machines are required for other auxiliary machinery essential to propulsion, automatic change-over devices shall be provided. <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=119&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 14</A></H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4 Automatic control and alarm system</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4.1 The control system shall be such that the service needed for the operation of the main propulsion machinery and its auxiliaries are ensured through the necessary automatic arrangements.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4.2 An alarm shall be given on the automatic change-over.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4.3 An alarm system complying with Regulation 51 shall be provided for all important pressures, temperatures and fluid levels and other essential parameters.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4.4 A centralized control position, shall be arranged with the necessary alarm panels and instrumentation indicating any alarm.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>5 Means shall be provided to keep the starting air pressure at the required level where internal combustion engines are used for main propulsion.</H4></BODY></HTML>
