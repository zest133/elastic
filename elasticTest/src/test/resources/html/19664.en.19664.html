<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 The final conditions of the ship after damage and, in the case of unsymmetrical flooding, after equalization measures have been taken shall be as follows:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 in the case of symmetrical flooding there shall be a positive residual metacentric height of at least 50mm as calculated by the constant displacement method;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 in the case of unsymmetrical flooding, the angle of heel for one-compartment flooding shall not exceed 7˚. For the simultaneous flooding of two or more adjacent compartments, a heel of 12° may be permitted by the Administration</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 in no case shall the margin line be submerged in the final stage of flooding. If it is considered that the margin line may become submerged during an intermediate stage of flooding, the Administration may require such investigations and arrangements as it considers necessary for the safety of the ship.</H5></BODY></HTML>
