<H4 class=subtitle align=left>19.1 For inert gas systems of both the flue, gas type and the inert gas generator type, audible and visual alarms shall be provided to indicate:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 low water pressure or low water flow rate to the flue gas scrubber as referred to in paragraph 6.1</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 high water level in the flue gas scrubber as referred to in paragraph 6.1;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 high gas temperature as referred to in paragraph 15;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 failure of the inert gas blowers referred to in paragraph 7;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 oxygen content in excess of 8 per cent by volume as referred to in paragraph 16.1.2;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 failure of the power supply to the automatic control system for the gas regulating valve and to the indicating devices as referred to in paragraphs 9 and 16.1;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.7 low water level in the water seal as referred to in paragraph 10.1;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.8 gas pressure less than 100mm water gauge as referred to in paragraph 16.1.1. The alarm arrangement shall be such as to ensure that the pressure in slop tanks in combination carriers can be monitored at all times;and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.9 high gas pressure as referred to in paragraph 16.1.1.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>19.2 For inert gas systems of the inert gas generator type, additional audible and visual alarms shall be provided to indicate:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 insufficient fuel oil supply;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 failure of the power supply to the generator;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 failure of the power supply to the automatic control system for the generator.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>19.3 Automatic shut-down of the inert gas blowers and gas regulating valve shall be arranged on predetermined limits being reached in respect of paragraphs 19.1.1, 19.1.2 and 19.1.3.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>19.4 Automatic shut-down of the gas regulating valve shall be arranged in respect of paragraph 19.1.4.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>19.5 In respect of paragraph 19.1.5, when the oxygen content of the inert gas exceeds 8 per cent by volume, immediate action shall be taken to improve the gas quality. Unless the quality of the gas improves, all cargo tank operations shall be suspended so as to avoid air being drawn in to the tanks and the isolation valve referred to in paragraph 10.8 shall be closed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>19.6 The alarms required in paragraphs 19.1.5. 19.1.6 and 19.1.8 shall be fitted in the machinery space and cargo control room, where provided, but in each case in such a position that they are immediately received by responsible members of the crew.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>19.7 In respect of paragraph 19.1.7 the Administration shall be satisfied as to the maintenance of an adequate reserve of water at all times and the integrity of the arrangements to permit the automatic formation of the water seal when the gas flow ceases. The audible and visual alarm on the low level of water in the water seal shall operate when the inert gas is not being supplied.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>19.8 An audible alarm system independent of that required in paragraph 19.1.8 or automatic shut-down of cargo pumps shall be provided to operate on predetermined limits of low pressure in the inert gas mains being reached.</H4>
