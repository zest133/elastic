<H3 class=regulation align=center>Sample extraction smoke detection systems</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(This regulation applies to ships constructed on or after 1 February 1992)</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 General requirements</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 Wherever in the text of this regulation the word "system" appears, it shall mean "sample extraction smoke detection system".</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 Any required system shall be capable of continuous operation at all times except that systems operating on a sequential scanning principle may be accepted, provided that the interval between scanning the same position twice gives an overall response time to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3 Power supplies necessary for the operation of the system shall be monitored for loss of power. Any loss of power shall initiate a visual and audible signal at the control panel and the navigating bridge which shall be distinct from a signal indicating smoke detection.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.4 An alternative power supply for the electrical equipment used in the operation of the system shall be provided.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.5 The control panel shall be located on the navigating bridge or in the main fire control station.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.6 The detection of smoke or other products of combustion shall initiate a visual and audible signal at the control panel and the navigating bridge.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.7 Clear information shall be displayed on or adjacent to the control panel designating the spaces covered.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.8 The sampling pipe arrangements shall be such that the location of the fire can be readily identified.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.9 Suitable instructions and component spares shall be provided for the testing and maintenance of the system.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.10 The functioning of the system shall be periodically tested to the satisfaction of the Administration. The system shall be of a type that can be tested for correct operation and restored to normal surveillance without the renewal of any component.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.11 The system shall be designed, constructed and installed so as to prevent the leakage of any toxic or flammable substances or fire-extinguishing media into any accommodation and service space, control station or machinery space.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Installation requirements</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 At least one smoke accumulator shall be located in every enclosed space for which smoke detection is required. However, where a space is designed to carry oil or refrigerated cargo alternatively with cargoes for which a smoke sampling system is required, means may be provided to isolate the smoke accumulators in such compartments for the system. Such means shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 Smoke accumulators shall be located for optimum performance and shall be spaced so that no part of the overhead deck area is more than 12 m measured horizontally from an accumulator. Where systems are used in spaces which may be mechanically ventilated, the position of the smoke accumulators shall be considered having regard to the effects of ventilation.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3 Smoke accumulators shall be positioned where impact or physical damage is unlikely to occur.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.4 Not more than four accumulators shall be connected to each sampling point.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.5 Smoke accumulators from more than one enclosed space shall not be connected to the same sampling point.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.6 Sampling pipes shall be self-draining and suitably protected from impact or damage from cargo working.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Design requirements</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 The system and equipment shall be suitably designed to withstand supply voltage variation and transients, ambient temperature changes, vibration, humidity, shock;, impact and corrosion normally encountered in ships and to avoid the possibility of ignition of flammable gas air mixture.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 The sensing unit shall be certified to operate before the smoke density within the sensing chamber exceeds 6.65% obscuration per metre.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.3 Duplicate sample extraction fans shall be provided. The fans shall be of sufficient capacity to operate with the normal conditions or ventilation in the protected area and shall give an overall response time to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.4 The control panel shall permit observation of smoke in the individual sampling pipe.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.5 Means shall be provided to monitor the airflow through the sampling pipes so designed as to ensure that as far as practicable equal quantities are extracted from each interconnected accumulator.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.6 Sampling pipes shall be a minimum of 12 mm internal diameter except when used in conjunction with fixed gas fire-extinguishing systems when the minimum size of pipe should be sufficient to permit the fire-extinguishing gas to be discharged within the appropriate time.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.7 Sampling pipes shall be provided with an arrangement for periodically purging with compressed air.</H5>
