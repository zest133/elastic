<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 Marine evacuation systems shall be in such positions as to ensure safe launching having particular regard to clearance from the propeller and steeply overhanging positions of the hull and so that, as far as practicable, the system can be launched down the straight side of the ship.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 Each marine evacuation system shall be stowed so that neither the passage nor platform nor its stowage or operational arrangements will interfere with the operation of any other life-saving appliance at any other launching station.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4 Where appropriate, the ship shall be so arranged that the marine evacuation systems in their stowed positions are protected from damage by heavy seas.</H4></BODY></HTML>
