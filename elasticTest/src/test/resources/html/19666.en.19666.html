<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7.1 The master of the ship shall be supplied with the data necessary to maintain sufficient intact stability under service conditions to enable the ship to withstand the critical damage, In the case of ships requiring cross-flooding the master of the ship be informed of the conditions of stability on which the calculations of heel are based and be warned that excessive heeling might result should the ship sustain damage when in a less favourable condition.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7.2 The data referred to in paragraph 7.1, to enable the master to maintain sufficient intact stability, shall include information which indicates the maximum permissible height of the ship's centre of gravity above keel (KG), or alternatively the minimum permissible metacentric height (GM) for a range of draughts or displacements sufficient to include all service conditions. The information shall show the influence of various trims taking into account the operational limits.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7.3 Each ship shall have scales of draughts marked clearly at the bow and stern. In the case where the draught marks are not located where they are easily readable, or operational constraints for a particular trade make it difficult to read the draught marks, then the ship shall also be fitted with a reliable draught indicating system by which the bow and stern draughts can be determined.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7.4 On completion of loading of the ship and prior to its departure, the master shall determine the ship's trim and stability and also ascertain and record that the ship is in compliance with stability criteria in relevant regulations. The Administration may accept the use of an electronic loading and stability computer or equivalent means for this purpose.</H4>
