Such doors may be hinged, rolling or sliding doors but shall not be remotely controlled. They shall be fitted at the highest level and as far from the shell plating as practicable, but in no case shall the outboard vertical edges be situated at a distance from the shell plating which is less than one fifth of the breadth of the ship, as defined in regulation 2, such distance being measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision load line.</H4>

Should any of the doors be accessible during the voyage, they shall be fitted with a device which prevents unauthorized opening, When it is proposed to fit such doors, the number and arrangements shall receive the special consideration of the Administration.</H4>
