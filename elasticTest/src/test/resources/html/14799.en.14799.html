<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10 "International Life-Saving Appliance(LSA) Code"(referred to as "the Code" in this chapter) means the International Life-Saving Appliance(LSA) Code adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee of the Organization by resolution MSC.48(66), as it may be amended by the Organization, provided that such amendments are adopted, brought into force and take effect in accordance with the provisions of article VIII of the present Convention concerning the amendment procedures applicable to the Annex other than chapter I.</H4>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>12 "Length" is 96% of the total length on a waterline at 85% of the least moulded depth measured from the top of the keel, or the length from the fore-side of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, if that be greater. In ships designed with a rake of keel the waterline on which this is measured shall be parallel to the designed waterline.</H4>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>15 "Moulded depth"</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 The moulded depth is the vertical distance measured from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam a side. In wood and composite ships the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet. Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the distance is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 In ships having rounded gunwales, the moulded depth shall be measured to the point of intersection of the moulded lines of the deck and side shell plating, the lines extending as though the gunwale were of angular design.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 Where the freeboard deck is stepped and the raised part of the deck extends over the point at which the moulded depth is to be determined, the moulded depth shall be measured to a line of reference extending from the lower part of the deck along a line parallel with the raised part.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>16 "Novel life-saving appliance or arrangement" is a life-saving appliance or arrangement which embodies new features not fully covered by the provisions of this chapter or the Code but which provides an equal or higher standard of safety.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>17 "Positive stability" is the ability of a craft to return to its original position after the removal of a heeling moment.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>18 "Recovery time" for a rescue boat is the time required to raise the boat to a position where persons on board can disembark to the deck of the ship. Recovery time includes the time required to make preparations for recovery on board the rescue boat such as passing and securing a painter, connecting the rescue boat to the launching appliance, and the time to raise the rescue boat. Recovery time does not include the time needed to lower the launching appliance into position to recover the rescue boat.</H4>

The final port of destination is the last port of call in the scheduled voyage at which the ship commences its return voyage to the country in which the voyage began.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>23 "Survival craft" is a craft capable of sustaining the lives of persons in distress from the time of abandoning the ship.</H4>
