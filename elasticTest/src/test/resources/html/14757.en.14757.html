<H3 class=regulation align=center>Machinery controls</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Main and auxiliary machinery essential for the propulsion and safety of the ship shall be provided with effective means for its operation and control.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Where remote control of propulsion machinery from the navigating bridge is provided and the machinery spaces are intended to be manned, the following shall apply :</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 the speed, direction of thrust and, if applicable, the pitch of the propeller shall be fully controllable from the navigating bridge under all sailing conditions, including manoeuvring ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 the remote control shall be performed, for each independent propeller, by a control device so designed and constructed that its operation does not require particular attention to the operational details of the machinery. Where multiple propellers are designed to operate simultaneously, they may be controlled by one control device ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 the main propulsion machinery shall be provided with an emergency stopping device on the navigating bridge which shall be independent of the navigating bridge control system ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 propulsion machinery orders from the navigating bridge shall be indicated in the main machinery control room or at the manoeuvring platform as appropriate ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 remote control of the propulsion machinery shall be possible only from one location at a time; at such locations interconnected control positions are permitted. At each location there shall be an indicator showing which location is in control of the propulsion machinery. The transfer of control between the navigating bridge and machinery spaces shall be possible only in the main machinery space or the main machinery control room. This system shall include means to prevent the propelling thrust from altering significantly when transferring control from one location to another ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 it shall be possible to control the propulsion machinery locally, even in the case of failure in any part of the remote control system ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.7 the design of the remote control system shall be such that in case of its failure an alarm will be given. Unless the Administration considers it impracticable the preset speed and direction of thrust of the propellers shall be maintained until local control is in operation ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.8 indicators shall be fitted on the navigating bridge for :</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.8.1 propeller speed and direction of rotation in the case of fixed pitch propellers ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.8.2 propeller speed and pitch position in the case of controllable pitch propellers ;</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.9 an alarm shall be provided on the navigating bridge and in the machinery space to indicate low starting air pressure which shall be set at a level to permit further main engine starting operations. If the remote control system of the propulsion machinery is designed for automatic starting, the number of automatic consecutive attempts which fail to produce a start shall be limited in order to safeguard sufficient starting air pressure for starting locally.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Where the main propulsion and associated machinery, including sources of main electrical supply, are provided with various degrees of automatic or remote control and are under continuous manual supervision from a control room the arrangements and controls shall be so designed, equipped and installed that the machinery operation will be as safe and effective as if it were under direct supervision; for this purpose regulations 46 to 50 shall apply as appropriate. Particular consideration shall be given to protect such spaces against fire and flooding.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 In general, automatic starting, operational and control systems shall include provisions for manually overriding the automatic controls. Failure of any part of such systems shall not prevent the use of the manual override.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph 1 to 4, ships constructed on or after 1 July 1998 shall comply with the following requirements :</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 Main and auxiliary machinery essential for the propulsion, control and safety of the ship shall be provided with effective means for its operation and control. All control systems essential for the propulsion, control and safety of the ship shall be independent or designed such that failure of one system does not degrade the performance of another system.";</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 Where remote control of propulsion machinery from the navigating bridge is provided, the following shall apply :</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.1 the speed, direction of thrust and, if applicable, the pitch of the propeller shall be fully controllable from the navigating bridge under all sailing conditions, including manoeuvring ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.2 the control shall be performed by a single control device for each independent propeller, with automatic performance of all associated services, including, where necessary, means of preventing overload of the propulsion machinery ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.3 the main propulsion machinery shall be provided with an emergency stopping device on the navigating bridge which shall be independent of the navigating bridge control system ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.4 propulsion machinery orders from the navigation bridge shall be indicated in the main machinery control room and at the manoeuvring platform ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.5 remote control of the propulsion machinery shall be possible only from one location at a time; at such locations interconnected control positions are permitted. At each location there shall be an indicator showing which locations is in control of the propulsion machinery. The transfer of control between the navigating bridge and machinery spaces shall be possible only in the main machinery space or the main machinery control room. This system shall include means to prevent the propelling thrust from altering significantly when transferring control from one location to another ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.6 it shall be possible to control the propulsion machinery locally, even in the case of failure in any part of the remote control system. It shall also be possible to control the auxiliary machinery, essential for the propulsion and safety of the ship, at or near the machinery concerned ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.7 the design of the remote control system shall be such that in case of its failure an alarm will be given. Unless the Administration considers it impracticable the preset speed and direction of thrust of the propellers shall be maintained until local control is in operation ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.8 indicators shall be fitted on the navigation bridge, the main machinery control room and at the manoeuvring platform, for :</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.8.1 propeller speed and direction of rotation in the case of fixed pitch propellers ; and</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.8.2 propeller speed and pitch position in the case of controllable pitch propellers ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.9 an alarm shall be provided on the navigating bridge and in the machinery space to indicate low starting air pressure which shall be set at a level to permit further main engine starting operations. If the remote control system of the propulsion machinery is designed for automatic starting, the number of automatic consecutive attempts which fail to produce a start shall be limited in order to safeguard sufficient starting air pressure for starting locally.</H6>
