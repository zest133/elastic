<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.3.1 Ducts passing through "A" class divisions shall meet the following requirements:</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.1 where a thin plated duct with a free cross sectional area equal to, or less than, 0.02 m<SUP>2</SUP> passes through "A" class divisions, the opening shall be fitted with a steel sheet sleeve having a thickness of at least 3 mm and a length of at least 200 mm, divided preferably into 100 mm on each side of a bulkhead or, in the case of a deck, wholly laid on the lower side of the decks penetrated;</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.2 where ventilation ducts with a free cross-sectional area exceeding 0.02 m<SUP>2</SUP>, but not more than 0.075 m<SUP>2</SUP>, pass through "A" class divisions, the openings shall be lined with steel sheet sleeves. The ducts and sleeves shall have a thickness of at least 3 mm and a length of at least 900 mm. When passing through bulkheads, this length shall be divided preferably into 450 mm on each side of the bulkhead. These ducts, or sleeves lining such ducts, shall be provided with fire insulation. The insulation shall have at least the same fire integrity as the division through which the duct passes; and</U></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify><U>.3 automatic fire dampers shall be fitted in all ducts with a free cross-sectional area exceeding 0.075 m<SUP>2</SUP> that pass through "A" class divisions. Each damper shall be fitted close to the division penetrated and the duct between the damper and the division penetrated shall be constructed of steel in accordance with paragraphs 7.2.4.2.1 and 7.2.4.2.2. The fire damper shall operate automatically, but shall also be capable of being closed manually from both sides of the division. The damper shall be fitted with a visible indicator which shows the operating position of the damper. Fire dampers are not required, however, where ducts pass through spaces surrounded by "A" class divisions, without serving those spaces, provided those ducts have the same fire integrity as the divisions which they penetrate. A duct of cross-sectional area exceeding 0.075 m<SUP>2</SUP> shall not be divided into smaller ducts at the penetration of an "A" class division and then recombined into the original duct once through the division to avoid installing the damper required by this provision.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.3.2 Ventilation ducts with a free cross-sectional area exceeding 0.02 m<SUP>2</SUP> passing through "B" class bulkheads shall be lined with steel sheet sleeves of 900 mm in length, divided preferably into 450 mm on each side of the bulkheads unless the duct is of steel for this length.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.3.3 All fire dampers shall be capable of manual operation. The dampers shall have a direct mechanical means of release or, alternatively, be closed by electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic operation. All dampers shall be manually operable from both sides of the division. Automatic fire dampers, including those capable of remote operation, shall have a failsafe mechanism that will close the damper in a fire even upon loss of electrical power or hydraulic or pneumatic pressure loss. Remotely operated fire dampers shall be capable of being reopened manually at the damper.</U></H6>
