<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3.2 Means of escape in passenger ships *</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=footnote>* Refer to the Interim Guidelines for evacuation analysis for new and existing passenger ships (<A href="/CONTENTS.ASPX?CategoryID=44445">MSC/Circ. 1238</A>) </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>3.2.1 Escape from spaces below the bulkhead deck </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>3.2.1.1 Below the bulkhead deck two means of escape, at least one of which shall be independent of watertight doors, shall be provided from each watertight compartment or similarly restricted space or group of spaces. Exceptionally, the Administration may dispense with one of the means of escape for crew spaces that are entered only occasionally, if the required escape route is independent of watertight doors. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>3.2.1.2 Where the Administration has granted dispensation under the provisions of paragraph 3.2.1.1, this sole means of escape shall provide safe escape. However, stairways shall not be less than 800 mm in clear width with handrails on both sides. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>3.2.2 Escape from spaces above the bulkhead deck </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>Above the bulkhead deck there shall be at least two means of escape from each main vertical zone or similarly restricted space or group of spaces at least one of which shall give access to a stairway forming a vertical escape. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>3.2.3 Direct access to stairway enclosures </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>Stairway enclosures in accommodation and service spaces shall have direct access from the corridors and be of a sufficient area to prevent congestion, having in view the number of persons likely to use them in an emergency. Within the perimeter of such stairway enclosures, only public toilets, lockers of non-combustible material providing storage for non-hazardous safety equipment and open information counters are permitted. Only (<IMG alt="" src="/images/icon/link.gif">The words "public spaces," deleted by <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=39204&amp;localekey=en">Res.MSC.216(82)</A>)&nbsp;corridors, lifts, public toilets, special category spaces and open ro-ro spaces to which any passengers carried can have access, other escape stairways required by paragraph 3.2.4.1 and external areas are permitted to have direct access to these stairway enclosures. &nbsp;<U>Public spaces may also have direct access to stairway enclosures except for the backstage of a theatre.</U> (<IMG alt="" src="/images/icon/link.gif">Added by <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=39204&amp;localekey=en">Res.MSC.216(82)</A>) Small corridors or "lobbies" used to separate an enclosed stairway from galleys or main laundries may have direct access to the stairway provided they have a minimum deck area of 4.5 mÂ² , a width of no less than 900 mm and contain a fire hose station. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>3.2.4 Details of means of escape </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>3.2.4.1 At least one of the means of escape required by paragraphs 3.2.1.1 and 3.2.2 shall consist of a readily accessible enclosed stairway, which shall provide continuous fire shelter from the level of its origin to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks, or to the uppermost weather deck if the embarkation deck does not extend to the main vertical zone being considered. In the latter case, direct access to the embarkation deck by way of external open stairways and passageways shall be provided and shall have emergency lighting in accordance with regulation III/11.5 and slip-free surfaces underfoot. Boundaries facing external open stairways and passageways forming part of an escape route and boundaries in such a position that their failure during a fire would impede escape to the embarkation deck shall have fire integrity, including insulation values, in accordance with tables 9.1 to 9.4, as appropriate. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>3.2.4.2 Protection of access from the stairway enclosures to the lifeboat and liferaft embarkation areas shall be provided either directly or through protected internal routes which have fire integrity and insulation values for stairway enclosures as determined by tables 9.1 to 9.4, as appropriate. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>3.2.4.3 Stairways serving only a space and a balcony in that space shall not be considered as forming one of the required means of escape. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>3.2.4.4 Each level within an atrium shall have two means of escape, one of which shall give direct access to an enclosed vertical means of escape meeting the requirements of paragraph 3.2.4.1. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>3.2.4.5 The widths, number and continuity of escapes shall be in accordance with the requirements in the Fire Safety Systems Code. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>3.2.5 Marking of escape routes </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>3.2.5.1 In addition to the emergency lighting required by regulations II-1/42 and III/11.5, the means of escape, including stairways and exits, shall be marked by lighting or photoluminescent strip indicators placed not more than 300 mm above the deck at all points of the escape route including angles and intersections. The marking must enable passengers to identify the routes of escape and readily identify the escape exits. If electric illumination is used, it shall be supplied by the emergency source of power and it shall be so arranged that the failure of any single light or cut in a lighting strip will not result in the marking being ineffective. Additionally, escape route signs and fire equipment location markings shall be of photoluminescent material or marked by lighting. The Administration shall ensure that such lighting or photoluminescent equipment has been evaluated, tested and applied in accordance with the Fire Safety Systems Code. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>3.2.5.2 In passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers, the requirements of the paragraph 3.2.5.1 shall also apply to the crew accommodation areas. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3><U>3.2.5.3 In lieu of the escape route lighting system required by paragraph 3.2.5.1, alternative evacuation guidance systems may be accepted if approved by the Administration based on the guidelines developed by the Organization*.</U> (<IMG alt="" src="/images/icon/link.gif">Added by <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=39204&amp;localekey=en">Res.MSC.216(82)</A>) </H6>

<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=footnote><U>* Refer to the Functional requirements and performance standards for the assessment of evacuation guidance systems (<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=36102&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.1167</A>) and the Interim guidelines for the testing, approval and maintenance of evacuation guidance systems used as an alternative to low-location lighting systems (<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=36103&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.1168</A>).</U> </H6></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>3.2.6 Normally locked doors that form part of an escape route </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>3.2.6.1 Cabin and stateroom doors shall not require keys to unlock them from inside the room. Neither shall there be any doors along any designated escape route which require keys to unlock them when moving in the direction of escape. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>3.2.6.2 Escape doors from public spaces that are normally latched shall be fitted with a means of quick release. Such means shall consist of a door-latching mechanism incorporating a device that releases the latch upon the application of a force in the direction of escape flow. Quick release mechanisms shall be designed and installed to the satisfaction of the Administration and, in particular: </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>.1 consist of bars or panels, the actuating portion of which extends across at least one half of the width of the door leaf, at least 760 mm and not more than 1120 mm above the deck; </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>.2 cause the latch to release when a force not exceeding 67 N is applied; and </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>.3 not be equipped with any locking device, set screw or other arrangement that prevents the release of the latch when pressure is applied to the releasing device. </H6></BODY></HTML>
