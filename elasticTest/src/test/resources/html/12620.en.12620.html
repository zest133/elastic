<H3 class=regulation align=center>Definitions relating to Parts C, D, and E</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>For the purpose of Parts C,D, and E, unless expressly provided otherwise:</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 "Steering gear control system" is the equipment by which orders are transmitted from the navigating bridge to the steering gear power units. Steering gear control systems comprise transmitters, receivers, hydraulic control pumps and their associated motors, motor controllers, piping and cables.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 "Main steering gear" is the machinery, rudder actuators, steering gear, power units, if any, and ancillary equipment and the means of applying torque to the rudder stock (e.g. tiller or quadrant) necessary for effecting movement of the rudder for the purpose of steering the ship under normal service conditions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 "Steering gear power unit" is:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 in the case of electric steering gear, an electric motor and its associated electrical equipment;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 in the case of electrohydraulic steering gear, an electric motor and its associated electrical equipment and connected pump;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 in the case of other hydraulic steering gear, a driving engine and connected pump.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 "Auxiliary steering gear" is the equipment other than any part of the main steering gear necessary to steer the ship in the event of failure of the main steering gear but not including the tiller, quadrant or components serving the same purpose.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 "Normal operational and habitable condition" is a condition under which the ship as a whole, the machinery, services, means and aids ensuring propulsion, ability to steer, safe navigation, fire and flooding safety, internal and external communications and signals, means of escape, and emergency boat winches, as well as the designed comfortable conditions of habitability are in working order and functioning normally.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 "Emergency condition" is a condition under which any services needed for normal operational and habitable conditions are not in working order due to failure of the main source of electrical power.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 "Main source of electrical power" is a source intended to supply electrical power to the main switchboard for distribution to all services necessary for maintaining the ship in normal operational and habitable conditions.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 "Dead ship condition" is the condition under which the main propulsion plant, boilers and auxiliaries are not in operation due to the absence of power.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9 "Main generating station" is the space in which the main source of electrical power is situated.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10 "Main switchboard" is a switchboard which is directly supplied by the main source of electrical power and is intended to distribute electrical energy to the ship's services.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11 "Emergency switchboard" is a switchboard which in the event of failure of the main electrical power supply system is directly supplied by the emergency source of electrical power or the transitional source of emergency power and is intended to distribute electrical energy to the emergency services.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>12 "Emergency source of electrical power" is a source of electrical power, intended to supply the emergency switchboard in the event of a failure of the supply from the main source of electrical power.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>13 "Power actuating system" is the hydraulic equipment provided for supplying power to turn the rudder stock, comprising a steering gear power unit or units, together with the associated pipes and fittings, and a rudder actuator. The power actuating systems may share common mechanical components, i.e., tiller, quadrant and rudder stock, or components serving the same purpose.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>14 "Maximum ahead service speed" is the greatest speed which the ship is designed to maintain in service at sea at the deepest sea-going draught.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>15 "Maximum astern speed' is the speed which it is estimated the ship can attain at the designed maximum astern power at the deepest sea-going draught.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>16 "Machinery spaces" are all machinery spaces of category A and all other spaces containing propelling machinery, boilers, oil fuel units, steam and internal combustion engines, generators and major electrical machinery, oil filling stations, refrigerating, stabilizing, ventilation and air conditioning machinery, and similar spaces, and trunks to such spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>17 "Machinery spaces of category A" are those spaces and trunks to such spaces which contain:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 internal combustion machinery used for main propulsion; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 internal combustion machinery used for purposes other than main propulsion where such machinery has in the aggregate a total power output of not less than 375Kw; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 any oil-fired boiler or oil fuel unit.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>18 "Control stations" are those spaces in which the ship's radio or main navigating equipment or the emergency source of power is located or where the fire recording or fire control equipment is centralized.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>19 "Chemical tanker" is a cargo ship constructed or adapted and used for the carriage in bulk of any liquid product listed in either:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 chapter 17 of the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee by resolution MSC.4(48), hereinafter referred to as 'the International Bulk Chemical Code', as may be amended by the Organization; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 chapter VI of the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk adopted by the Assembly of the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=6972&amp;localekey=en">A.212(VII), </A>hereinafter referred to as 'the Bulk Chemical Code', as has been or may be amended by the Organization; whichever is applicable.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>20 "Gas carrier" is a cargo ship constructed or adapted and used for the carriage in bulk of any liquefied gas or other products listed in either:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 chapter 19 of the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee by resolution MSC.5(48) hereinafter referred to as 'the International Gas Carrier Code', as may be amended by the Organization; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 chapter XIX of the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk adopted by the Assembly of the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7008&amp;localekey=en">A.328(IX)</A>, hereinafter referred to as 'the Gas Carrier Code', as has been or may be amended by the Organization; whichever is applicable.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>21 "Deadweight" is the difference in tonnes between the displacement of a ship in water of a specific gravity of 1.025 at the load water-line corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard and the lightweight of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>22 "Lightweight" is the displacement of a ship in tonnes without cargo, fuel, lubricating oil, ballast water, fresh water and feedwater in tanks, consumable stores, and passengers and crew and their effects.</H4></BODY></HTML>
