<H4 class=subtitle align=left>SECTION I - STRENGTH OF GRAIN FITTINGS</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(A) General (including working stresses)</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(B) Divisions loaded on both sides</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(C) Divisions loaded on one side only</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(D) Saucers</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(E) Bundling of bulk</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(F) Securing hatch covers of filled compartments</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>SECTION II - SECURING OF PARTLY FILLED COMPARTMENTS</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(A) Strapping or lashing</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(B) Overstowing arrangements</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(C) Bagged grain</H5>
<H2 class=part align=center>SECTION I - STRENGTH OF GRAIN FITTINGS</H2>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>(A) GENERAL</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Timber</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>All timber used for grain fittings shall be of good sound quality and of a type and grade which has been proved to be satisfactory for this purpose. The actual finished dimensions of the timber shall be in accordance with the dimensions hereinafter specified in this Part. Plywood of an exterior type bonded with waterproof glue and fitted so that the direction of the grain in the face plies is perpendicular to the supporting uprights or binder may be used provided that its strength is equivalent to that of solid timber of the appropriate scantlings.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Working Stresses</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>When calculating the dimensions of divisions loaded on one side, using the Tables in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sub-Section (C) of this Section, the following working stresses should be adopted:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>For divisions of steel. . . . . . 2000 kg per square cm</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>For divisions of wood. . . . . . 160 kg per square cm</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Other Materials</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Materials other than wood or steel may be approved for such divisions provided that proper regard has been paid to their mechanical properties.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) Uprights</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Unless means are provided to prevent the ends of uprights being dislodged from their sockets, the depth of housing at each end of each upright shall be not less than 75 mm. If an upright is not secured at the top, the uppermost shore or stay shall be fitted as near thereto as is practicable.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) The arrangements provided for inserting shifting boards by removing a part of the cross-section of an upright shall be such that the local level of stresses is not unduly high.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) The maximum bending moment imposed upon an upright supporting a division loaded on one side shall normally be calculated assuming that the ends of the uprights are freely supported. However, if an Administration is satisfied that any degree of fixity assumed will be achieved in practice, account may be taken of any reduction in the maximum bending moment arising from any degree of fixity provided at the ends of the upright.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) Composite Section</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Where uprights, binders or any other strength members are formed by two separate sections, one fitted on each side of a division and inter-connected by through bolts at adequate spacing, the effective section modules shall be taken as the sum of the two module of the separate sections.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) Partial Division</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Where divisions do not extend to the full depth of the hold such divisions and their uprights shall be supported or stayed so as to be as efficient as those which do extend to the full depth of the hold.</H5></BODY></HTML>
