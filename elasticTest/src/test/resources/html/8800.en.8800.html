<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Fire Pumps, Fire Mains, Hydrants and Hoses</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(a) Total Capacity of Fire Pumps</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) In a passenger ship, the required fire pumps shall be capable of delivering for fire-fighting purposes a quantity of water, at the appropriate pressure prescribed below, not less than two-thirds of the quantity required to be dealt with by the bilge pumps when employed for bilge pumping.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) In a cargo ship, the required fire pumps, other than the emergency pump (if any), shall be capable of delivering for fire-fighting purposes a quantity of water, at the appropriate pressure prescribed, not less than four-thirds of the quantity required under Regulation 18 of Chapter II-1 to be dealt with by each of the independent bilge pumps in a passenger ship of the same dimensions when employed on bilge pumping, provided that in no cargo ship need the total required capacity of the fire pumps exceed 180 cubic metres per hour.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(b) Fire Pumps</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) The fire pumps shall be independently driven. Sanitary, ballast, bilge or general service pumps may be accepted as fire pumps, provided that they are not normally used for pumping oil and that if they are subject to occasional duty for the transfer or pumping of fuel oil, suitable change-over arrangements are fitted.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii)</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(1) In passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers, each of the required fire pumps shall have a capacity not less than 80 per cent of the total required capacity divided by the minimum number of required fire pumps and each such pump shall in any event be capable of delivering at least the two required jets of water. These fire pumps shall be capable of supplying the fire main system under the required conditions. Where more pumps than the minimum of required pumps are installed the capacity of such additional pumps shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(2) In all other types of ships (e. g. passenger ships carrying not more than 36 passengers), each of the required fire pumps (other than any emergency pump required by Regulation 52 of this Chapter) shall have a capacity not less than 80 per cent of the total required capacity divided by the number of required fire pumps, and shall in any event be capable of supplying the fire main system under the required conditions. Where more pumps than required are installed their capacity shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(iii) Relief valves shall be provided in conjunction with all fire pumps if the pumps are capable of developing a pressure exceeding the design pressure of the water service pipes, hydrants and hoses. These valves shall be so placed and adjusted as to prevent excessive pressure in any part of the fire main system.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(c) Pressure in the Fire Main</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) The diameter of the fire main and water service pipes shall be sufficient for the effective distribution of the maximum required discharge from two fire pumps operating simultaneously, except that in the case of cargo ships the diameter need only be sufficient for the discharge of 140 cubic metres per hour.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) With the two pumps simultaneously delivering through nozzles specified in paragraph (g) of this Regulation the quantity of water specified in sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph, through any adjacent hydrants, the following minimum pressures shall be maintained at all hydrants :</H5>

<DIV>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(d) Number and Position of Hydrants</H4></DIV>
<DIV>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>The number and position of the hydrants shall be such that at least two jets of water not emanating from the same hydrant, one of which shall be from a single length of hose, may reach any part of the ship normally accessible to the passengers or crew while the ship is being navigated.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(e) Pipes and Hydrants</H4></DIV>
<DIV>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) Materials readily rendered ineffective by heat shall not be used for fire mains and hydrants unless adequately protected. The pipes and hydrants shall be so placed that the fire hoses may be easily coupled to them. In ships where deck cargo may be carried, the positions of the hydrants shall be such that they are always readily accessible and the pipes shall be arranged as far as practicable to avoid risk of damage by such cargo. Unless there is provided one hose and nozzle for each hydrant in the ship, there shall be complete interchangeability of hose couplings and nozzles.</H5></DIV>
<DIV>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) A cock or valve shall be fitted to serve each fire hose so that any fire hose may be removed while the fire pumps are at work.</H5></DIV>
<DIV>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(f) Fire Hoses</H4></DIV>
<DIV>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>Fire hoses shall be of material approved by the Administration and sufficient in length to project a jet of water to any of the spaces in which they may be required to be used. Their maximum length shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration. Each hose shall be provided with a nozzle and the necessary couplings. Hoses specified in this Chapter as "fire hoses" shall together with any necessary fittings and tools be kept ready for use in conspicuous positions near the water service hydrants or connections. Additionally in interior locations in passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers, fire hoses shall be connected to the hydrants at all times.</H5></DIV>
<DIV>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(g) Nozzles</H4></DIV>
<DIV>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) For the purposes of this Chapter, standard nozzle sizes shall be 12 millimetres (½ inch), 16 millimetres(5/8 inch) and 19 millimetres (3/4 inch) or as near thereto as possible. Larger diameter nozzles may be permitted at the discretion of the Administration.</H5></DIV>
<DIV>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) For accommodation and service spaces, a nozzle size greater than 12 millimetres (½ inch) need not be used.</H5></DIV>
<DIV>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(iii) For machinery spaces and exterior locations, the nozzle size shall be such as to obtain the maximum discharge possible from two jets at the pressure mentioned in paragraph (c) of this Reg. from the smallest pump, provided that a nozzle size greater than 19 millimetres (3/4 inch) need not be used.</H5></DIV>
<DIV>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(iv) For machinery spaces or in similar spaces where the risk of spillage of oil exists, the nozzles shall be suitable for spraying water on oil or alternatively shall be of a dual purpose type.</H5></DIV>
