<H2 class=part align=center>PART B - SUBDIVISION AND STABILITY*</H2>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Instead of the requirements in this Part, the Regulations on Subdivision and Stability of Passenger Ships as an Equivalent to Part B of Chapter II of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960, adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=6986&amp;localekey=en">A.265(VIII), </A>may be used, if applied in their entirety.</H6>
<H2 class=part align=center>(Part B applies to passenger ships and to cargo ships,as indicated in the regulations)</H2>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 4</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Floodable length in passenger ships</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The floodable length at any point of the length of a ship shall be determined by a method of calculation which takes into consideration the form, draught and other characteristics of the ship in question.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 In a ship with a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length at a given point is the maximum portion of the length of the ship, having its centre at the point in question, which can be flooded under the definite assumptions set forth in Regulation 5 without the ship being submerged beyond the margin line.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.1 In the case of a ship not having a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length at any point may be determined to an assumed continuous margin line which at no point is less than 76 mm below the top of the deck (at side) to which the bulkheads concerned and the shell are carried watertight.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.2 Where a portion of an assumed margin line is appreciably below the deck to which bulkheads are carried, the Administration may permit a limited relaxation in the watertightness of those portions of the bulkheads which are above the margin line and immediately under the higher deck.</H4></BODY></HTML>
