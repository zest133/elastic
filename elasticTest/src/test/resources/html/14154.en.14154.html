<H3 class=regulation align=center>Application</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.1 Unless expressly provided otherwise, this Chapter shall apply to ships the keels of which are laid or which are at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 July 1986.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.2 For the purpose of this Chapter, the term "a similar stage of construction" means the stage at which:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 construction identifiable with a specific ship begins; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 assembly of that ship has commenced comprising at least 50 tonnes or one per cent of the estimated mass of all structural material, whichever is less.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.3 For the purpose of this Chapter:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 the expression "ships constructed" means "ships the keels of which are laid or which are at a similar stage of construction";</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 the expression "all ships" means "ships constructed before, on or after 1 July 1986";</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 a cargo ship, whenever built, which is converted to a passenger ship shall be treated as a passenger ship constructed on the date on which such a conversion commences.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Unless expressly provided otherwise, for ships constructed before 1 July 1986 the Administration shall ensure that the requirements which are applicable under chapter II-1 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended by resolution MSC.1 (XLV), are complied with.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.1 All ships which undergo repairs, alterations, modifications and outfitting related thereto shall continue to comply with at least the requirements previously applicable to these ships. Such ships if constructed before 1 July 1986 shall, as a rule, comply with the requirements for ships constructed on or after that date to at least the same extent as they did before undergoing such repairs, alterations, modifications or outfitting. Repairs, alterations and modifications of a major character and outfitting related thereto shall meet the requirements for ships constructed on or after 1 July 1986 in so far as the Administration deems reasonable and practicable.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.2 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3.1, passenger ships which undergo repairs, alterations and modifications to meet the requirements of regulation 8.9 shall not be deemed to have undergone repairs, alterations and modifications of a major character.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 The administration of a State may, if it considers that the sheltered nature and conditions of the voyage are such as to render the application of any specific requirements of this Chapter unreasonable or unnecessary, exempt from those requirements individual ships or classes of ships entitled to fly the flag of that State which, in the course of their voyage, do not proceed more than 20 miles from the nearest land.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 In the case of passenger ships which are employed in special trades for the carriage of large numbers of special trade passengers, such as the pilgrim trade, the Administration of the State whose flag such ships are entitled to fly, if satisfied that it is impracticable to enforce compliance with the requirements of this Chapter, may exempt such ships from those requirements, provided that they comply fully with the provisions of:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 the Rules annexed to the Special Trade Passenger Ships Agreement, 1971; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 the Rules annexed to the Protocol on Space Requirements for Special Trade Passenger Ships, 1973.</H5>
