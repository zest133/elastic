<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2><U>6.1.4 The requirement of this paragraph shall apply to ships constructed on or after 1 January 2010. Ships constructed on or after 1 July 2002 and before 1 January 2010 shall comply with the previously applicable requirements of paragraph 6.1.4, as amended by resolution MSC.99(73). When fixed pressure waterspraying systems are fitted, in view of the serious loss of stability which could arise due to large quantities of water accumulating on the deck or decks during the operation of the fixed pressure water-spraying system, the following arrangements shall be provided:</U> </H6>

<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body5><U>.1.2.1 in ro-ro passenger ships, discharge valves for scuppers, fitted with positive means of closing operable from a position above the bulkhead deck in accordance with the requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines in force, shall be kept open while the ships are at sea;</U> </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body5><U>.1.2.2 any operation of valves referred to in paragraph 6.1.4.1.2.1 shall be recorded in the log-book;</U> </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4><U>.1.3 in the spaces below the bulkhead deck, the Administration may require pumping and drainage facilities to be provided additional to the requirements of regulation II-1/35-1. In such case, the drainage system shall be sized to remove no less than 125% of the combined capacity of both the water-spraying system pumps and the required number of fire hose nozzles, taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization*. The drainage system valves shall be operable from outside the protected space at a position in the vicinity of the extinguishing system controls. Bilge wells shall be of sufficient holding capacity and shall be arranged at the side shell of the ship at a distance from each other of not more than 40 m in each watertight compartment;</U> </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3><U>.2 in cargo ships, the drainage and pumping arrangements shall be such as to prevent the build-up of free surfaces. In such case, the drainage system shall be sized to remove no less than 125% of the combined capacity of both the water-spraying system pumps and the required number of fire hose nozzles, taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization*. The drainage system valves shall be operable from outside the protected space at a position in the vicinity of the extinguishing system controls. Bilge wells shall be of sufficient holding capacity and shall be arranged at the side shell of the ship at a distance from each other of not more than 40 m in each watertight compartment. If this is not possible, the adverse effect upon stability of the added weight and free surface of water shall be taken into account to the extent deemed necessary by the Administration in its approval of the stability information**. Such information shall be included in the stability information supplied to the master as required by regulation II-1/5-1.</U> </H6>
