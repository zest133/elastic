<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 44</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Totally enclosed lifeboats</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Totally enclosed lifeboats shall comply with the requirements of regulation 41 and in addition shall comply with the requirements of this regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Enclosure</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Every totally enclosed lifeboat shall be provided with a rigid watertight enclosure which completely encloses the lifeboat. The enclosure shall be so arranged that:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 it protects the occupants against heat and cold;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 access to the lifeboat is provided by hatches which can be closed to make the lifeboat watertight;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 hatches are positioned so as to allow launching and recovery operations to be performed without any occupant having to leave the enclosure;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 access hatches are capable of being opened and closed from both inside and outside and are equipped with means to hold them securely in open positions;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 it is possible to row the lifeboat;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6 it is capable, when the lifeboat is in the capsized position with the hatches closed and without significant leakage, of supporting the entire mass of the lifeboat, including all equipment, machinery and its full complement of persons;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.7 it includes windows or translucent panels on both sides which admit sufficient daylight to the inside of the lifeboat with the hatches closed to make artificial light unnecessary;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.8 its exterior is of a highly visible colour and its interior of a colour which does not cause discomfort to the occupants;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.9 handrails provide a secure handhold for persons moving about the exterior of the lifeboat, and aid embarkation and disembarkation;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.10 persons have access to their seats from an entrance without having to climb over thwarts or other obstructions;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.11 the occupants are protected from the effects of dangerous sub atmospheric pressures which might be created by the lifeboat's engine.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Capsizing and re-righting</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 A safety belt shall be fitted at each indicated seating position. The safety belt shall be designed to hold a person of a mass of 100 kg securely in place when the lifeboat is in a capsized position.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 The stability of the lifeboat shall be such that it is inherently or automatically self-righting when loaded with its full or a partial complement of persons and equipment and all entrances and openings are closed watertight and the persons are secured with safety belts.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.3 The lifeboat shall be capable of supporting its full complement of persons and equipment when the lifeboat is in the damaged condition prescribed in regulation 41.1.1 and its stability shall be such that in the event of capsizing, it will automatically attain a position that will provide an above-water escape for its occupants.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.4 The design of all engine exhaust pipes, air ducts and other openings shall be such that water is excluded from the engine when the lifeboat capsizes and re-rights.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Propulsion</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 The engine and transmission shall be controlled from the helmsman's position.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 The engine and engine installation shall be capable of running in any position during capsize and continue to run after the lifeboat returns to the upright or shall automatically stop on capsizing and be easily restarted after the lifeboat returns to the upright. The design of the fuel and lubricating systems shall prevent the loss of fuel and the loss of more than 250 ml of lubricating oil from the engine during capsize.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.3 Air cooled engines shall have a duct system to take in cooling air from, and exhaust it to, the outside of the lifeboat. Manually operated dampers shall be provided to enable cooling air to be taken in from, and exhausted to, the interior of the lifeboat.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Construction and fendering</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Notwithstanding regulation 41.1.6, a totally enclosed lifeboat shall be so constructed and fendered as to ensure that the lifeboat renders protection against harmful accelerations resulting from an impact of the lifeboat, when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment, against the ship's side at an impact velocity of not less than 3.5 m/s.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Free-fall lifeboats</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>A lifeboat arranged for free-fall launching shall be so constructed that it is capable of rendering protection against harmful accelerations resulting from being launched, when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment, from at least the maximum height at which it is designed to be stowed above the waterline with the ship in its lightest seagoing condition, under unfavourable conditions of trim of up to 10° and with the ship listed not less than 20° either way. </H5></BODY></HTML>
