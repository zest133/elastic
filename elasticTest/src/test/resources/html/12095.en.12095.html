<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fixed low-expansion foam fire-extinguishing systems</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>in machinery spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Where in any machinery space a fixed low-expansion foam fire-extinguishing system is fitted in addition to the requirements of Regulation 7, such system shall be capable of discharging through fixed discharge outlets in not more than five minutes a quantity of foam sufficient to cover to a depth of 150mmthe largest single area over which oil fuel is liable to spread. The system shall be capable of generating foam suitable for extinguishing oil fires. Means shall be provided for effective distribution of the foam through a permanent system of piping and control valves or cocks to suitable discharge outlets, and for the foam to be effectively directed by fixed sprayers on other main fire hazards in the protected space. The expansion ratio of the foam shall not exceed 12 to 1.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The means of control of any such systems shall be readily accessible and simple to operate and shall be grouped together in as few locations as possible at positions not likely to be cut off by a fire in the protected space.</H4></BODY></HTML>
