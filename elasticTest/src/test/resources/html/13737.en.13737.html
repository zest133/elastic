<H3 class=regulation align=center>Definitions</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>For the purpose of these regulations, unless expressly provided otherwise:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 Subdivision load line is a waterline used in determining the subdivision of the ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 "Deepest subdivision load line" is the subdivision load line which corresponds to the summer draught to be assigned to the ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3 "Partial load line" is the light ship draught plus 60% of the difference between the light ship draught and deepest subdivision load line.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 "Subdivision length of the ship (" L s")" is the greatest projected moulded length of that part of the ship at or below deck or decks limiting the vertical extent of flooding with the ship at the deepest subdivision load line.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 "Mid-length" is the mid point of the subdivision length of the ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3 "Aft terminal" is the aft limit of the subdivision length.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.4 "Forward terminal" is the forward limit of the subdivision length.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3 "Breadth ("B") "is the greatest moulded breadth of the ship at or below the deepest subdivision load line.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4 "Draught ("d")" is the vertical distance from the moulded baseline at mid-length to the waterline in question.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5 "Permeability ("Î¼")" of a space is the proportion of the immersed volume of that space which can be occupied by water.</H5>
