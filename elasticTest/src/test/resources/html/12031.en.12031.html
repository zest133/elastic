<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Steam boilers and boiler feed systems</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>1 Every steam boiler and every unfired steam generator shall be provided with not less than two safety valves of adequate capacity. However, having regard to the output or any other features of any boiler or unfired steam generator, the Administration may permit only one safety valve to be fitted if it is satisfied that adequate protection against overpressure is thereby provided.</H4>

<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 Each oil-fired boiler which is intended to operate without manual supervision shall have safety arrangements which shut off the fuel supply and give an alarm in the case of low water level, air supply failure or flame failure. </H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 Water tube boilers serving turbine propulsion machinery shall be fitted with a high-water-level alarm.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4 Every steam generating system which provides services essential for the safety of the ship, or which could be rendered dangerous by the failure of its feed water supply, shall be provided with not less than two separate feed water systems from and including the feed pumps, noting that a single penetration of the steam drum is acceptable. Unless overpressure is prevented by the pump characteristics means shall be provided which will prevent overpressure in any part of the systems.</H4>

<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>5 Boilers shall be provided with means to supervise and control the quality of the feed water. Suitable arrangements shall be provided to preclude, as far as practicable, the entry of oil or other contaminants which may adversely affect the boiler.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>6 Every boiler essential for the safety of the ship and designed to contain water at a specified level shall be provided with at least two means for indicating its water level, at least one of which shall be a direct reading gauge glass.</H4></BODY></HTML>
