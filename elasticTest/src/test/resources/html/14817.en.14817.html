<H3 class=regulation align=center>Launching stations</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Launching stations shall be in such positions as to ensure safe launching having particular regard to clearance from the propeller and steeply overhanging portions of the hull and so that, as far as possible, survival craft, except survival craft specially designed for free-fall launching, can be launched down the straight side of the ship. If positioned forward, they shall be located abaft the collision bulkhead in a sheltered position and, in this respect, the Administration shall give special consideration to the strength of the launching appliance.</H4>
