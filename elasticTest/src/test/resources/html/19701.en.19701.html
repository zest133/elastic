<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Passenger ships</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 The bilge pumping system required by paragraph 1.1 shall be capable of operation under all practicable conditions after a casualty whether the ship is upright or listed. For this purpose wing suctions shall generally be fitted except in narrow compartments at the end of the ship where one suction may be sufficient. In compartments of unusual form, additional suctions may be required. Arrangements shall be made whereby water in the compartment may find its way to the suction pipes. Where, for particular compartments, the Administration is satisfied that the provision of drainage may be undesirable, it may allow such provision to be dispensed with if calculations made in accordance with the conditions laid down in Reg. 8.2.1 to 8.2 3 show that the survival capability of the ship will not be impaired.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 At least three power pumps shall be fitted connected to the bilge main, one of which may be driven by the propulsion machinery. Where the criterion numeral is 30 or more, one additional independent power pump shall be provided.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3 Where practicable, the power bilge pumps shall be placed in separate watertight compartments and so arranged or situated that these compartments will not be flooded by the same damage. If the main propulsion machinery, auxiliary machinery and boilers are in two or more watertight compartments, the pumps available for bilge service shall be distributed as far as is possible throughout these compartments.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.4 On a ship of 91.5 m in length and upwards or having a criterion numeral of 30 or more, the arrangements shall be such that at least one power bilge pump shall be available for use in all flooding conditions which the ship is required to withstand, as follows:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 one of the required bilge pumps shall be an emergency pump of a reliable submersible type having a source of power situated above the bulkhead deck; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 the bilge pumps and their sources of power shall be so distributed throughout the length of the ship that at least one pump in an undamaged compartment will be available.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.5 With the exception of additional pumps which may be provided for peak compartments only, each required bilge pump shall be so arranged as to draw water from any space required to be drained by paragraph 1.1.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.6 Each power bilge pump shall be capable of pumping water through the required main bilge pipe at a speed of not less than 2 m/sec. Independent power bilge pumps situated in machinery spaces shall have direct suctions from these spaces, except that not more than two such suctions shall be required in any one space. Where two or more such suctions are provided there shall be at least one on each side of the ship. The Administration may require independent power bilge pumps situated in other spaces to have separate direct suctions. Direct suctions shall be suitably arranged and those in a machinery space shall be of a diameter not less than that required for the bilge main.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.7.1 In addition to the direct bilge suction or suctions required by paragraph 2.6 a direct suction from the main circulating pump leading to the drainage level of the machinery space and fitted with a non-return valve shall be provided in the machinery space. The diameter of this direct suction pipe shall be at least two-thirds of the diameter of the pump inlet in the case of steamships, and of the same diameter as the pump inlet in the case of motor ships.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.7.2 Where in the opinion of the Administration the main circulating pump is not suitable for this purpose, a direct emergency bilge suction shall be led from the largest available independent power driven pump to the drainage level of the machinery space; the suction shall be of the same diameter as the main inlet of the pump used. The capacity of the pump so connected shall exceed that of a required bilge pump by an amount deemed satisfactory by the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.7.3 The spindles of the sea inlet and direct suction valves shall extend well above the engine room platform.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.8 All bilge suction piping up to the connection to the pumps shall be independent of other piping.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.9 The diameter d of the bilge main shall be calculated according to the following formula. However, the actual internal diameter of the bilge main may be rounded off to the nearest standard size acceptable to the Administration:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>d = 25 + 1.68 Ã— L ( B + D)</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>where :</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>d is the internal diameter of the bilge main (millimetres);</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>L and B are the length and the breadth of the ship (metres) as defined in Reg. 2; and</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>D is the moulded depth of the ship to the bulkhead deck (metres) provided that, in a ship having an enclosed cargo space on the bulkhead deck which is internally drained in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 1.6.2 and which extends for the full length of the ship, D shall be measured to the next deck above the bulkhead deck. Where the enclosed cargo spaces cover a lesser length, D shall be taken as the moulded depth to the bulkhead deck plus lh/L where l and h are the aggregate length and height respectively of the enclosed cargo spaces (metres). </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>The diameter of the bilge branch pipes shall meet the requirements of the Administration.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.10 Provision shall be made to prevent the compartment served by any bilge suction pipe being flooded in the event of the pipe being severed or otherwise damaged by collision or grounding in any other compartment. For this purpose, where the pipe is at any part situated nearer the side of the ship than one-fifth of the breadth of the ship (as defined in Reg. 2 and measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision load line), or is in a duct keel, a non-return valve shall be fitted to the pipe in the compartment containing the open end.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.11 Distribution boxes, cocks and valves in connection with the bilge pumping system shall be so arranged that, in the event of flooding, one of the bilge pumps may be operative on any compartment; in addition, damage to a pump or its pipe connecting to the bilge main outboard of a line drawn at one-fifth of the breadth of the ship shall not put the bilge system out of action. If there is only one system of pipes common to all the pumps, the necessary valves for controlling the bilge suctions must be capable of being operated from above the bulkhead deck. Where in addition to the main bilge pumping system an emergency bilge pumping system is provided, it shall be independent of the main system and so arranged that a pump is capable of operating on any compartment under flooding condition as specified in paragraph 2.1; in that case only the valves necessary for the operation of the emergency system need be capable of being operated from above the bulkhead deck.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.12 All cocks and valves referred to in paragraph 2.11 which can be operated from above the bulkhead deck shall have their controls at their place of operation clearly marked and shall be provided with means to indicate whether they are open or closed.</H5>
