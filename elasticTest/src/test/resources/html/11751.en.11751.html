<H2 class=part style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">SUBDIVISION, WATERTIGHT AND WEATHERTIGHT INTEGRITY</H2>
<H3 class=regulation style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Regulation 9</H3>
<H3 class=regulation style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Double bottoms in passenger ships and cargo ships other than tankers</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">1 A double bottom shall be fitted extending from the collision bulkhead to the afterpeak bulkhead, as far as this is practicable and compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">2 Where a double bottom is required to be fitted the inner bottom shall be continued out to the ship's sides in such a manner as to protect the bottom to the turn of the bilge. Such protection will be deemed satisfactory if the inner bottom is not lower at any part than a plane parallel with the keel line and which is located not less than a vertical distance h measured from the keel line, as calculated by the formula:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">h = B/20</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">However, in no case is the value of h to be less than 760 mm, and need not be taken as more than 2,000 mm.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">3 Small wells constructed in the double bottom in connection with drainage arrangements of holds, etc., shall not extend downward more than necessary. A well extending to the outer bottom is, however, permitted at the after end of the shaft tunnel. Other wells (e.g., for lubricating oil under main engines) may be permitted by the Administration if satisfied that the arrangements give protection equivalent to that afforded by a double bottom complying with this regulation. In no case shall the vertical distance from the bottom of such a well to a plane coinciding with the keel line be less than 500 mm.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">4 A double bottom need not be fitted in way of watertight tanks, including dry tanks of moderate size, provided the safety of the ship is not impaired in the event of bottom or side damage.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">5 In the case of passenger ships to which the provisions of regulation 1.5 apply and which are engaged on regular service within the limits of a short international voyage as defined in regulation III/3.22, the Administration may permit a double bottom to be dispensed with if satisfied that the fitting of a double bottom in that part would not be compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">6 Any part of a passenger ship or a cargo ship that is not fitted with a double bottom in accordance with paragraphs 1, 4 or 5 shall be capable of withstanding bottom damages, as specified in paragraph 8, in that part of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">7 In the case of unusual bottom arrangements in a passenger ship or a cargo ship, it shall be demonstrated that the ship is capable of withstanding bottom damages as specified in paragraph 8.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">8 Compliance with paragraphs 6 or 7 is to be achieved by demonstrating that si, when calculated in accordance with regulation 7-2, is not less than 1 for all service conditions when subject to a bottom damage assumed at any position along the ship's bottom and with an extent specified in subparagraph .2 below for the affected part of the ship:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 Flooding of such spaces shall not render emergency power and lighting, internal communication, signals or other emergency devices inoperable in other parts of the ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 Assumed extent of damage shall be as follows:</H5>

<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">9 In case of large lower holds in passenger ships, the Administration may require an increased double bottom height of not more than B/10 or 3 m, whichever is less, measured from the keel line. Alternatively, bottom damages may be calculated for these areas, in accordance with paragraph 8, but assuming an increased vertical extent.</H4></BODY></HTML>
