<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 38</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Protection of cargo spaces, other than special category spaces, intended for the carriage of motor vehicles with fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(Paragraph 1 of this regulation applies to ships constructed on or after 1 February 1992)</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>In any cargo space(other than special category spaces) containing motor vehicles with fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion, the following provisions shall be complied with.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Fire detection</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>There shall be provided a fixed fire detection and fire alarm system complying with the requirements of regulation 13 or a sample extraction smoke detection system complying with the requirements of regulation 13-1. The design and arrangements of this system shall be considered in conjunction with the ventilation requirements referred to in paragraph 3.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Fire-extinguishing arrangements</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 There shall be fitted a fixed fire-extinguishing system which shall comply with the provisions of Regulation 5, except that, if a carbon dioxide system is fitted, the quantity of gas available shall be at least sufficient to give a minimum volume of free gas equal to 45 percent of the gross volume of the largest such cargo space which is capable of being sealed, and the arrangements shall be such as to ensure that at least two thirds of the gas required for the relevant space shall be introduced during 10 minutes. Any other fixed gas fire-extinguishing system or fixed high expansion foam fire-extinguishing system may be fitted provided it gives equivalent protection. Furthermore, any cargo space designated only for vehicles which are not carrying any cargo may be fitted with fixed halogenated hydrocarbon fire-extinguishing system which shall comply with the provisions of Regulation 5.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 As an alternative, a system meeting the requirements of Regulation 37.1.3 may be fitted, provided that Regulation 37.2.1.1 or 37.3.1, as appropriate, is also complied with.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3 There shall be provided for use in any such space such number of portable fire extinguishers as the Administration may deem sufficient. At least one portable extinguisher shall be located at each access to such spaces.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Ventilation system</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 There shall be provided an effective power ventilation system sufficient to give at least 10 air changes per hour for ships carrying more than 36 passengers, and 6 air changes per hour for ships carrying not more than 36 passengers. The system for such cargo spaces shall be entirely separated from other ventilation systems and shall be operating at all times when vehicles are in such spaces. Ventilation ducts serving such cargo spaces capable of being effectively sealed shall be separated for each such space. The system shall be capable of being controlled from a position outside such spaces.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 The ventilation shall be such as to prevent air stratification and the formation of air pockets.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.3 Means shall be provided to indicate on the navigating bridge any loss or reduction of the required ventilating capacity.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.4 Arrangements shall be provided to permit a rapid shut-down and effective closure of the ventilation system in case of fire, taking into account the weather and sea conditions.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.5 Ventilation ducts, including dampers, shall be made of steel and their arrangement shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Precautions against ignition of flammable vapours.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 Electrical equipment and wiring, if fitted, shall be of a type suitable for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures. Other equipment which may constitute a source of ignition of flammable vapours shall not be permitted.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 Electrical equipment and wiring, if installed in an exhaust ventilation duct, shall be of a type approved for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures and the outlet from any exhaust duct shall be sited in a safe position, having regard to other possible sources of ignition.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.3 Scuppers shall not be led to machinery or other spaces where sources of ignition may be present.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Permanent openings for ventilation</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Permanent openings in the side plating, the ends or deckhead of cargo spaces shall be so situated that a fire in the cargo space does not endanger stowage areas and embarkation stations for survival craft and accommodation spaces, service spaces and control stations in superstructures and deckhouses above the cargo spaces.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Structural protection</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>For ro-ro cargo spaces of ships constructed on or after 1 July 1998, the requirements of paragraphs 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 of regulation 38-1 shall be complied with.</H5></BODY></HTML>
