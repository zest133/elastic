<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fixed Froth Fire-Extinguishing Systems in Machinery Spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>(a) Any required fixed froth fire-extinguishing system in machinery spaces shall be capable of discharging through fixed discharge outlets in not more than five minutes, a quantity of froth sufficient to cover to a depth of 150 millimetres (6 inches) the largest single area over which oil fuel is liable to spread. The system shall be capable of generating froth suitable for extinguishing oil fires. Means shall be provided for effective distribution of the froth through a permanent system of piping and control valves or cocks to suitable discharge outlets, and for the froth to be effectively directed by fixed sprayers on other main fire hazards in the protected space. The expansion ratio of the froth shall not exceed 12 to 1.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>(b) The means of control of any such systems shall be readily accessible and simple to operate and shall be grouped together in as few locations as possible at positions not likely to be cut off by a fire in the protected space.</H4></BODY></HTML>
