<H4 class=subtitle align=left>For the purpose of this chapter, unless expressly provided otherwise:</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 "Certificated person" is a person who holds a certificate of proficiency in survival craft issued under the authority of, or recognized as valid by, the Administration in accordance with the requirements of the international Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch keeping for Seafarers, in force; or a person who holds a certificate issued or recognized by the Administration of a State not a Party to that Convention for the same purpose as the convention certificate.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 "Detection" is the determination of the location of survivors or survival craft.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 "Embarkation ladder" is the ladder provided at survival craft embarkation stations to permit safe access to survival craft after launching.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 "Float-free launching" is that method of launching a survival craft whereby the craft is automatically released from a sinking ship and is ready for use.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 "Free fall launching" is that method of launching a survival craft whereby the craft with its complement of persons and equipment on board is released and allowed to fall into the sea without any restraining apparatus.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 "Immersion suit" is a protective suit which reduces the body heat loss of a person wearing it in cold water.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 "Inflatable appliance" is an appliance which depends upon non rigid, gas filled chambers for buoyancy and which is normally kept uninflated until ready for use.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 "Inflated appliance" is an appliance which depends upon non rigid, gas filled chambers for buoyancy and which is kept inflated and ready for use at all times.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9 "Launching appliance or arrangement" is a means of transferring a survival craft or rescue boat from its stowed position safely to the water.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10 "Length" is 96% of the total length on a waterline at 85% of the least moulded depth measured from the top of the keel, or the length from the fore side of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, if that be greater. In ships designed with a rake of keel the waterline on which this is measured shall be parallel to the designed waterline.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11 "Moulded depth"</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 The moulded depth is the vertical distance measured from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side. In wood and composite ships the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet. Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the distance is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 In ships having rounded gunwales, the moulded depth shall be measured to the point of intersection of the moulded lines of the deck and side shell plating, the lines extending as though the gunwale were of angular design.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 Where the free board deck is stepped and the raised part of the deck extends over the point at which the moulded depth is to be determined, the moulded depth shall be measured to a line of reference extending from the lower part of the deck along a line parallel with the raised part.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>12 "Novel life saving appliance or arrangement" is a life saving appliance or arrangement which embodies new features not fully covered by the provisions of this chapter but which provides an equal or higher standard of safety.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>13 "Rescue boat" is a boat designed to rescue persons in distress and to marshal survival craft.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>14 "Retrieval" is the safe recovery of survivors.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>15 "Retro-reflective material" is a material which reflects in the opposite direction a beam of light directed on it.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>16 "Short international voyage" is an international voyage in the course of which a ship is not more than 200 miles from a port or place in which the passengers and crew could be placed in safety. Neither the distance between the last port of call in the country in which the voyage begins and the final port of destination nor the return voyage shall exceed 600 miles. The final port of destination is the last port of call in the scheduled voyage at which the ship commences its return voyage to the country in which the voyage began.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>17 "Survival craft" is a craft capable of sustaining the lives of persons in distress from the time of abandoning the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>18 "Thermal protective aid' is a bag or suit made of waterproof material with low thermal conductivity.</H4></BODY></HTML>
