<H3 class=regulation>(B) ASSUMPTIONS</H3>
<H3 class=regulation>In the following paragraphs it is assumed that the total heeling moment for a compartment is obtained by adding the results of separate considerations of the following portions:</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle>(a) Before and abaft hatchways:</H4>
<H5 class=body1>(i) If a compartment hastwo or more main hatchways through which loading may take place the depth of the underdeck void for the portion(s) between such hatchways shall be determined using the fore and aft distance to the midpoint between the hatchways.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(ii) After the assumed shift of grain the final void pattern shall be as shown in Figure 2 below:</H5>

<H5 class=body1>Notes on Figure 2:</H5>
<H6 class=body2>(1) If the maximum void area which can be formed against the girder at B is less than the initial area of the void under AB, i.e. AB x Vd, the excess area shall be assumed to transfer to the final void on the high side.</H6>
<H6 class=body2>(2) If the longitudinal division at C is one which has been provided in accordance with sub-paragraph (b)(ii) of Regulation 5 of this Chapter it shall extend to at least 0.6 metre below D or E whichever gives the greater depth.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle>(b) In and abreast hatchways:</H4>
<H5 class=body1>After the assumed shift of grain the final void pattern shall be as shown in the following Figure 3 or Figure 4.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><A name=#1597780310></A>
<P align=center><IMG alt="" src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.74.a01.062.2020/en/unia82e.gif" width=532 height=215></P> </H5>
<H5 class=body1>Notes on figure 3:</H5>
<H6 class=body2>(1) AB Any area in excess of that which can be formed against the girder at B shall transfer to the final void area in the hatchway.</H6>
<H6 class=body2>(2) CD Any area in excess of that which can be formed against the girder at E shall transfer to the final void area on the high side.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><A name=#1597780311></A>
<P align=center><IMG alt="" src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.74.a01.062.2020/en/unia83d.gif" width=506 height=202></P> </H6>
<H5 class=body1>Notes on Figure 4:</H5>
<H6 class=body2>(1) If the centreline division is one which has been provided in accordance with sub-paragraph (b)(ii) of Regulation 5 of this Chapter it shall extend to at least 0.6 metre below H or J whichever gives the greater depth.</H6>
<H6 class=body2>(2) The excess void area from AB shall transfer to the low side half of the hatchway in which two separate final void areas will be formed viz. one against the centreline division and the other against the hatch side coaming and girder on the high side.</H6>
<H6 class=body2>(3) If a bagged saucer or bulk bundle is formed in a hatchway it shall be assumed, for the purpose of calculating transverse heeling moment, that such a device is at least equivalent to the centreline division.</H6></BODY></HTML>
