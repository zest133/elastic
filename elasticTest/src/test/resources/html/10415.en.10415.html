<H3 class=regulation>Cubic Capacity of Lifeboats</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle>(a) The cubic capacity of a lifeboat shall be determined by Simpson's (Stirling's) Rule or by any other method giving the same degree of accuracy. The capacity of a square-sterned lifeboat shall be calculated as if the lifeboat had a pointed stern.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>(b) For example, the capacity in cubic m (or cubic feet) of a lifeboat, calculated by the aid of Simpson's Rule, may be considered as given by the following formula :</H4>

<H5 class=body1>L being the length of the lifeboat in m (or feet) from the inside of the planking or plating at the stem to the corresponding point at the stern post; in the case of a lifeboat with a square stern, the length is measured to the inside of the transom. A, B, C denote respectively the areas of the cross-sections at the quarter length forward, amidships, and the quarter-length aft, which correspond to the three points obtained by dividing L into four equal parts. (The areas corresponding to the two ends of the lifeboat are considered negligible.) The areas A, B, C shall be deemed to be given in square m (or square feet) by the successive application of the following formula to each of the three cross-sections:</H5>

<H5 class=body1>h being the depth measured in m (or in feet) inside the planking or plating from the keel to the level of the gunwale, or, in certain cases, to a lower level as determined hereafter.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>a, b, c, d, e denote the horizontal breadths of the lifeboat measured in m (or in feet) at the upper and lower points of the depth and at the three points obtained by dividing h into four equal parts (a and e being the breadths at the extreme point, and c at the middle point of h).</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>(c) If the sheer of the gunwale, measured at the two points situated at a quarter of the length of the lifeboat from the ends, exceeds 1 per cent of the length of the lifeboat the depth employed in calculating the area of the cross-sections A or C shall be deemed to be the depth amidships plus 1 per cent of the length of the lifeboat.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>(d) If the depth of the lifeboat amidships exceeds 45 per cent of the breadth, the depth employed in calculating the area of the a midship cross-section B shall be deemed to be equal to 45 per cent of the breadth, and the depth employed in calculating the areas of the quarter-length sections A and C is obtained by increasing this last figure by an amount equal to 1 per cent of the length of the lifeboat, provided that in no case shall the depths employed in the calculation exceed the actual depths at these points.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>(e) If the depth of the lifeboat is greater than 1.22 metres (4 feet) the number of persons given by the application of this Rule shall be reduced in proportion to the ratio of 1.22 metres (4 feet) to the actual depth, until the lifeboat has been satisfactorily tested afloat with that number of persons on board, all wearing life jackets.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>(f) The Administration shall impose, by suitable formulae, a limit for the number of persons allowed in lifeboats with very fine ends and in lifeboats very full in form.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>(g) The Administration may assign to a lifeboat constructed of wooden planks capacity equal to the product of the length, the breadth and the depth multiplied by 0.6 if it is evident that this formula does not give a greater capacity than that obtained by the above method. The dimensions shall then be measured in the following manner : Length - From the intersection of the outside of the planking with the stem to the corresponding point at the stern post or, in the case of a square-sterned boat, to the after side of the transom.</H4>
<H5 class=body1>Breadth - From the outside of the planking at the point where the breadth of the boat is greatest.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>Depth - Amidships inside the planking from the keel to the level of the gunwale, but the depth used in calculating the cubic capacity may not in any case exceed 45 per cent of the breadth.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>In all cases the shipowner has the right to require that the cubic capacity of the lifeboat shall be determined by exact measurement.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>(h) The cubic capacity of a motor lifeboat or a lifeboat fitted with other propelling gear shall be obtained from the gross capacity by deducting a volume equal to that occupied by the motor and its accessories or the gearbox of the other propelling gear, and, when carried, the radiotelegraph installation and searchlight with their accessories</H4></BODY></HTML>
