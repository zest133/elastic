<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fire-Extinguishing Systems and Equipment</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Application</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Where ships have a lower gross tonnage than those quoted in this Regulation, the arrangements for the items covered in this Regulation shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Fire Pumps and Fire Main System</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>The ship shall be provided with fire pumps, fire main system, hydrants and hoses complying with Regulation 5 of this Chapter and with the following requirements :</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(i) A ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall be provided with two independently driven power pumps.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(ii) In a ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards if a fire in any one compartment could put all the pumps out of action, there must be an alternative means of providing water for fire fighting. In a ship of 2,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards this alternative means shall be a fixed emergency pump independently driven. This emergency pump shall be capable of supplying two jets of water to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Fire Hydrants, Hoses and Nozzles</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) In a ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards the number of fire hoses to be provided, each complete with couplings and nozzles, shall be one for each 30 metres (100 feet) length of the ship and one spare but in no case less than five in all. This number does not include any hoses required in any engine or boiler room. The Administration may increase the number of the hoses required so as to ensure that hoses in sufficient number are available and accessible at all times, having regard to the type of the ship and the nature of the trade on which the ship is employed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) In accommodation, service and machinery spaces, the number and position of hydrants shall be such as to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of Regulation 5 of this Chapter.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) In a ship the arrangements shall be such that at least two jets of water can reach any part of any cargo space when empty.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) All required hydrants in the machinery spaces of ships with oil-fired boilers or internal combustion type propelling machinery shall be fitted with hoses having nozzles as required in paragraph (g) of Regulation 5 of this Chapter.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) International Shore Connexion</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) A ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall be provided with at least one international shore connexion, complying with paragraph (h) of Regulation 5 of this Chapter.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Facilities shall be available enabling such a connexion to be used on either side of the ship.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) Portable Fire Extinguishers in Accommodation and Service Spaces The ship shall be provided in accommodation and service spaces with such approved portable fire extinguishers as the Administration may deem to be appropriate and sufficient; in any case, their number shall not be less than five for ships of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) Fixed Fire-Extinguishing Arrangements in Cargo Spaces</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Cargo spaces of ships of 2,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall be protected by a fixed fire-extinguishing system complying with Regulation 8 of this Chapter.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) The Administration may exempt from the requirements of sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph the cargo holds of any ship (other than the tanks of a tanker):</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) if they are provided with steel hatch covers and effective means of closing all ventilators and other openings leading to the holds;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) if the ship is constructed and intended solely for carrying such cargoes as ore, coal or grain; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(3) where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that the ship is engaged on voyages of such short duration that it would be unreasonable to apply the requirement.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) Every ship in addition to complying with the requirements of this Regulation shall, while carrying explosives of such nature or in such quantity as are not permitted to be carried in passenger ships under Regulation 7 of Chapter VII of this Convention comply with the following requirements:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) Steam shall not be used in any compartment containing explosives. For the purpose of this sub-paragraph,"compartment" means all spaces contained between two adjacent permanent bulkheads and includes the lower hold and all cargo spaces above it.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) In addition, in each compartment containing explosives and in adjacent cargo compartments, there shall be provided a smoke- or fire-detection system in each cargo space.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) Fire-Extinguishing Appliances in Boiler Rooms, etc.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Where main or auxiliary oil-fired boilers are situated, or in spaces containing oil fuel units or settling tanks, a ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall be provided with the following arrangements:</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) There shall be any one of the following fixed fire-extinguishing installations :</H5>

(The Administration may require fixed or mobile arrangements by pressure water or froth spraying to fight fire above the floor plates.) In each case if the engine and boiler rooms are not entirely separate, or if fuel oil can drain from the boiler room into the engine room bilges, the combined engine and boiler rooms shall be considered as one compartment.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) There shall be at least two approved portable extinguishers discharging froth or other approved medium suitable for extinguishing oil fires in each firing space in each boiler room and each space in which a part of the oil fuel installation is situated. In addition, there shall be at least one extinguisher of the same description with a capacity of 9 litres (2 gallons) for each burner, provided that the total capacity of the additional extinguisher or extinguishers need not exceed 45 litres (10 gallons) for any one boiler room.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) In each firing space there shall be a receptacle containing sand, saw-dust impregnated with soda, or other approved dry material in such quantity as may be required by the Administration. Alternatively an approved portable extinguisher may be substituted therefor.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) Fire-Fighting Appliances in Spaces containing Internal Combustion Type Machinery Where internal combustion type engines are used, either for main propulsion machinery, or for auxiliary purposes associated with a total power output of not less than 746 kW, a ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall be provided with the following arrangements:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) There shall be one of the fixed arrangements required by sub-paragraph (g)(i) of this Regulation.</H5>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(i) Fire-Fighting Arrangements in Spaces containing Steam Turbines and not requiring any Fixed Installation</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>The Administration shall give special consideration to the fire-extinguishing arrangements to be provided in spaces containing steam turbines which are separated from boiler rooms by watertight bulkheads.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(j) Fireman's Outfits and Personal Equipment</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The ship, whether new or existing, shall carry at least two fireman's outfits complying with the requirements of Regulation 14 of this Chapter.
