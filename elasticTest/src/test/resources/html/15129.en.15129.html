<H3 class=regulation align=center>Position-updating</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>All two-way communication equipment carried on board a ship to which this chapter applies which is capable of automatically including the ship's position in the distress alert shall be automatically provided with this information from an internal or external navigation receiver, if either is installed. If such a receiver is not installed, the ship's position and the time at which the position was determined shall be manually updated at intervals not exceeding four hours, while the ship is underway, so that it is always ready for transmission by the equipment.</H4>
