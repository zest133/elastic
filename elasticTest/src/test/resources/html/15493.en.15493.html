<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Regulation 10</H3>
<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Radio equipment - Sea areas A1, A2 and A3</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>1 In addition to meeting the requirements of regulation 7, every ship engaged on voyages beyond sea areas A1 and A2, but remaining within sea area A3, shall, if it does not comply with the requirements of paragraph 2, be provided with :</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.1 an INMARSAT ship earth station capable of:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1.1 transmitting and receiving distress and safety communications using direct-printing telegraphy;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1.2 initiating and receiving distress priority calls;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1.3 maintaining watch for shore-to-ship distress alerts, including those directed to specifically defined geographical areas;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1.4 transmitting and receiving general radio communications, using either radiotelephony or direct-printing telegraphy; and</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.2 an MF radio installation capable of transmitting and receiving, for distress and safety purposes, on the frequencies:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2.1 2,187.5kHz using DSC; and</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2.2 2,182kHz using radiotelephony; and</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.3 a radio installation capable of maintaining a continuous DSC watch on the frequency 2,187.5kHz which may be separate from or combined with that required by subparagraph .2.1; and</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.4 means of initiating the transmission of ship-to-shore distress alerts by a radio service operating either:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.4.1 through the polar orbiting satellite service on 406MHz; this requirement may be fulfilled by the satellite EPIRB, required by regulation 7.1.6, either by installing the satellite EPIRB close to, or by remote activation from, the position from which the ship is normally navigated; or</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.4.2 on HF using DSC; or</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2><STRONG><EM><U>.4.3 through the Inmarsat geostationary satellite service by an additional ship earth station.</U> (<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=38492&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">Replaced by Res.MSC.201(81)</A>)</EM></STRONG></H6>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 In addition to meeting the requirements of regulation 7, every ship engaged on voyages beyond sea areas A1 and A2, but remaining within sea area A3, shall, if it does not comply with the requirements of paragraph 1, be provided with:</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.1 an MF/HF radio installation capable of transmitting and receiving, for distress and safety purposes, on all distress and safety frequencies in the bands between 1,605kHz and 4,000kHz and between 4,000kHz and 27,500kHz:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1.1 using DSC;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1.2 using radiotelephony; and</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1.3 using direct-printing telegraphy; and</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.2 equipment capable of maintaining DSC watch on 2,187.5kHz, 8,414.5kHz and on at least one of the distress and safety DSC frequencies 4,207.5kHz, 6312kHz, 12,577 kHz or 16,804.5kHz; at any time, it shall be possible to select any of these DSC distress and safety frequencies. This equipment may be separate from, or combined with the equipment required by subparagraph .1; and</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.3 means of initiating the transmission of ship-to-shore distress alerts by a radio communication service other than HF operating either:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.3.1 through the polar orbiting satellite service on 406 MHz; this requirement may be fulfilled by the satellite EPIRB, required by regulation 7.1.6, either by installing the satellite EPIRB close to, or by remote activation from, the position from which the ship is normally navigated; or</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2><STRONG><EM><U>.3.2 through the Inmarsat geostationary satellite service by a ship earth station; and</U> (<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=38492&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">Replaced by Res.MSC.201(81)</A>)</EM></STRONG></H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.4 in addition, ships shall be capable of transmitting and receiving general radio communications using radiotelephony or direct-printing telegraphy by an MF/HF radio installation operating on working frequencies in the bands between 1,605 kHz and 4,000kHz and between 4,000kHz and 27,500kHz. This requirement may be fulfilled by the addition of this capability in the equipment required by subparagraph .1</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 It shall be possible to initiate transmission of distress alerts by the radio installations specified in subparagraphs 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 2.1 and 2.3 from the position from which the ship is normally navigated.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4 The Administration may exempt ships constructed before 1 February 1997, and engaged exclusively on voyages within sea areas A2 and A3, from the requirements of regulations 7.1.1.1 and 7.1.2 provided such ships maintain, when practicable, a continuous listening watch on VHF channel 16. This watch shall be kept at the position from which the ship is normally navigated.</H4></BODY></HTML>
