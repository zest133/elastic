<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Manual alarms shall be fitted throughout the accommodation and service spaces to enable the fire patrol to give an alarm immediately to the navigating bridge or main fire control station.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) An approved fire alarm or fire detecting system shall be provided which will automatically indicate at one or more suitable points or stations the presence or indication of fire and its location in any cargo space which, in the opinion of the Administration, is not accessible to the patrol system, except where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that the ship is engaged on voyages of such short duration that it would be unreasonable to apply this requirement.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) The ship shall at all times when at sea, or in port (except when out of service), be so manned or equipped as to ensure that any initial fire alarm is immediately received by a responsible member of the crew.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(v) A special alarm, operated from the navigating bridge or fire control station, shall be fitted to summon the crew. This alarm may be part of the ship's general alarm system but it shall be capable of being sounded independently of the alarm to the passenger spaces.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vi) A public address system or other effective means of communication shall be available throughout the accommodation and service spaces and control stations.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Fire Pumps and Fire Main System</H4>

<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(i) In a ship of 4,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards, there shall be provided at least three independently-driven fire pumps and, in a ship of less than 4,000 tons gross tonnage, at least two such fire pumps.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(ii) In a ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards, the arrangement of sea connections, fire pumps and sources of power for operating them shall be such as to ensure that a fire in any one compartment will not put all the fire pumps out of action.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(iii) In a ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards, the arrangement of fire pumps, fire mains and hydrants shall be such that at least one effective jet of water as stipulated in paragraph (c) of Regulation 5 of this Chapter is immediately available from any one hydrant in an interior location. Arrangements shall also be made to ensure the continuation of the output of water by the automatic starting of a required fire pump.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(iv) In a ship of less than 1,000 tons gross tonnage the arrangements shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>

There shall be at least one fire hose for each of the hydrants required by paragraph (d) of Regulation 5 of this Chapter and these hoses shall be used only for the purposes of extinguishing fires or testing the fire-extinguishing apparatus at fire drills and surveys.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) In accommodation and service spaces and in machinery spaces, the number and position of hydrants shall be such that the requirements of paragraph (d) of Regulation 5 of this Chapter may be complied with when all watertight doors and all doors in main vertical zone bulkheads are closed.</H5>

Additionally, each machinery space of Category A shall be provided with at least two suitable water fog applicators.*</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* A water fog applicator might consist of a metal "L"-shaped pipe, the long limb being about 2 metres (6 feet) in length capable of being fitted to a fire hose and the short limb being about 250 millimetres (10 inches) in length fitted with a fixed water fog nozzle or capable of being fitted with a water spray nozzle.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(v) Water spray nozzles or dual-purpose nozzles shall be provided for at least one quarter of the number of hoses required in parts of the ship other than machinery spaces.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vi) For each pair of breathing apparatus there shall be provided one water fog applicator which shall be stored adjacent to such apparatus.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vii) Where, in any machinery space of Category A, access is provided at a low level from an adjacent shaft tunnel, two hydrants fitted with hoses with dual-purpose nozzles shall be provided external to, but near the entrance to that machinery space. Where such access is not provided from a tunnel but is provided from other space or spaces there shall be provided in one of those spaces two hydrants fitted with hoses with dual-purpose nozzles near the entrance to the machinery space of Category A. Such provision need not be made when the tunnel or adjacent spaces are not part of an escape route.</H5>
