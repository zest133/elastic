<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The hull, superstructure, structural bulkheads, decks and deckhouses shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Where fire protection in accordance with paragraph (b) of Regulation 40 of this Chapter is employed, the superstructure may be constructed of, for example, aluminium alloy, provided that:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) for the temperature rise of the metallic cores of "A" Class divisions when exposed to the standard fire test, due regard is given to the mechanical properties of the material;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) the Administration is satisfied that the amount of combustible materials used in the relevant part of the ship is suitably reduced; the ceilings (i.e. linings of deck heads) are non-combustible;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) adequate provision is made to ensure that in the event of fire, arrangements for stowage, launching and embarkation into survival craft remain as effective as if the superstructure were constructed of steel;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) crowns and casings of boiler and machinery spaces are of steel construction adequately insulated, and the openings therein, if any, are suitably arranged and protected to prevent spread of fire.</H5></BODY></HTML>
