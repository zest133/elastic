<H3 class=regulation align=center>Starting arrangements for emergency generating sets</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Emergency generating sets shall be capable of being readily started in their cold condition at a temperature of 0Â°C. If this is impracticable, or if lower temperatures are likely to be encountered, provision acceptable to the Administration shall be made for the maintenance of heating arrangements, to ensure ready starting of the generating sets.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Each emergency generating set arranged to be automatically started shall be equipped with starting devices approved by the Administration with a stored energy capability of at least three consecutive starts. A second source of energy shall be provided for an additional three starts within 30 minutes unless manual starting can be demonstrated to be effective.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 The stored energy shall be maintained at all times, as follows:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 electrical and hydraulic starting systems shall be maintained from the emergency switchboard;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 compressed air starting systems may be maintained by the main or auxiliary compressed air receivers through a suitable non-return valve or by an emergency air compressor which, if electrically driven, is supplied from the emergency switchboard;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 all of these starting, charging and energy storing devices shall be located in the emergency generator space; these devices are not to be used for any purpose other than the operation of the emergency generating set. This does not preclude the supply to the air receiver of the emergency generating set from the main or auxiliary compressed air system through the non-return valve fitted in the emergency generator space.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4.1 Where automatic starting is not required, manual starting is permissible, such as manual cranking, inertia starters, manually charged hydraulic accumulators, or powder charge cartridges, where they can be demonstrated as being effective.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4.2 When manual starting is not practicable, the requirements of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be complied with except that starting may be manually initiated.</H4>
