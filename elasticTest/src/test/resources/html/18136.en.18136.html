<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Application </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 Except as provided for in paragraph 1.2, this regulation applies to oil tankers of 500 gross tonnage and over and bulk carriers, as defined in regulation IX/1, of 20,000 gross tonnage and over, constructed on or after 1 January 2005. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 Oil tankers of 500 gross tonnage and over constructed on or after 1 October 1994 but before 1 January 2005 shall comply with the provisions of regulation <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=10394&amp;localekey=en">II-1/12-2</A> adopted by resolution MSC.27(61). </H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Means of access to cargo and other spaces </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 Each space within the cargo area shall be provided with a permanent means of access to enable, throughout the life of a ship, overall and close-up inspections and thickness measurements of the ship’s structures to be carried out by the Administration, the company, as defined in regulation IX/1, and the ship’s personnel and others as necessary. Such means of access shall comply with the requirements of paragraph 5 and with the Technical provisions for means of access for inspections, adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=25762&amp;localekey=en">MSC.133(76), </A>as may be amended by the Organization, provided that such amendments are adopted, brought into force and take effect in accordance with the provisions of article VIII of the present Convention concerning the amendment procedures applicable to the Annex other than chapter I. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 Where a permanent means of access may be susceptible to damage during normal cargo loading and unloading operations or where it is impracticable to fit permanent means of access, the Administration may allow, in lieu thereof, the provision of movable or portable means of access, as specified in the Technical provisions, provided that the means of attaching, rigging, suspending or supporting the portable means of access forms a permanent part of the ship’s structure. All portable equipment shall be capable of being readily erected or deployed by ship’s personnel. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3 The construction and materials of all means of access and their attachment to the ship’s structure shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration. The means of access shall be subject to survey prior to, or in conjunction with, its use in carrying out surveys in accordance with regulation I/10. </H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Safe access to cargo holds, cargo tanks, ballast tanks and other spaces </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 Safe access* to cargo holds, cofferdams, ballast tanks, cargo tanks and other spaces in the cargo area shall be direct from the open deck and such as to ensure their complete inspection. Safe access* to double bottom spaces may be from a pump-room, deep cofferdam, pipe tunnel, cargo hold, double hull space or similar compartment not intended for the carriage of oil or hazardous cargoes. </H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships, adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7323&amp;localekey=en">A.864(20). </A></H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 Tanks, and subdivisions of tanks, having a length of 35 m or more, shall be fitted with at least two access hatchways and ladders, as far apart as practicable. Tanks less than 35 m in length shall be served by at least one access hatchway and ladder. When a tank is subdivided by one or more swash bulkheads or similar obstructions which do not allow ready means of access to the other parts of the tank, at least two hatchways and ladders shall be fitted. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.3 Each cargo hold shall be provided with at least two means of access as far apart as practicable. In general, these accesses should be arranged diagonally, for example one access near the forward bulkhead on the port side, the other one near the aft bulkhead on the starboard side. </H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Ship structure access manual </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 A ship’s means of access to carry out overall and close-up inspections and thickness measurements shall be described in a Ship structure access manual approved by the Administration, an updated copy of which shall be kept on board. The Ship structure access manual shall include the following for each space in the cargo area: </H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 plans showing the means of access to the space, with appropriate technical specifications and dimensions; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 plans showing the means of access within each space to enable an overall inspection to be carried out, with appropriate technical specifications and dimensions. The plans shall indicate from where each area in the space can be inspected; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 plans showing the means of access within the space to enable close-up inspections to be carried out, with appropriate technical specifications and dimensions. The plans shall indicate the positions of critical structural areas, whether the means of access is permanent or portable and from where each area can be inspected; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 instructions for inspecting and maintaining the structural strength of all means of access and means of attachment, taking into account any corrosive atmosphere that may be within the space; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 instructions for safety guidance when rafting is used for close-up inspections and thickness measurements; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6 instructions for the rigging and use of any portable means of access in a safe manner; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.7 an inventory of all portable means of access; and </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.8 records of periodical inspections and maintenance of the ship’s means of access. </H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 For the purpose of this regulation ‘critical structural areas’ are locations which have been identified from calculations to require monitoring or from the service history of similar or sister ships to be sensitive to cracking, buckling, deformation or corrosion which would impair the structural integrity of the ship. </H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 General technical specifications </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.1 For access through horizontal openings, hatches or manholes, the dimensions shall be sufficient to allow a person wearing a self-contained air-breathing apparatus and protective equipment to ascend or descend any ladder without obstruction and also provide a clear opening to facilitate the hoisting of an injured person from the bottom of the space. The minimum clear opening shall not be less than 600 mm x 600 mm. When access to a cargo hold is arranged through the cargo hatch, the top of the ladder shall be placed as close as possible to the hatch coaming. Access hatch coamings having a height greater than 900 mm shall also have steps on the outside in conjunction with the ladder. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.2 For access through vertical openings, or manholes, in swash bulkheads, floors, girders and web frames providing passage through the length and breadth of the space, the minimum opening shall be not less than 600 mm x 800 mm at a height of not more than 600 mm from the bottom shell plating unless gratings or other foot holds are provided. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.3 For oil tankers of less than 5,000 tonnes deadweight, the Administration may approve, in special circumstances, smaller dimensions for the openings referred to in paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2, if the ability to traverse such openings or to remove an injured person can be proved to the satisfaction of the Administration. </H5></BODY></HTML>
