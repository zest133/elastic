<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=footnote>* Refer to the Recommended procedures to prevent the illegal or accidental use of low flashpoint cargo oil as fuel adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7122&amp;localekey=en">A.565(14). </A></H6></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 In emergency generators oil fuel with a flashpoint of not less than 43 degrees C may be used; </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.3 The use of oil fuel having a flashpoint of less than 60 degrees C but not less than 43 degrees C may be permitted (e.g., for feeding the emergency fire pump's engines and the auxiliary machines which are not located in the machinery spaces of category A) subject to the following: </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.3.1 fuel oil tanks except those arranged in double bottom compartments shall be located outside of machinery spaces of category A; </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.3.2 provisions for the measurement of oil temperature are provided on the suction pipe of the oil fuel pump; </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.3.3 stop valves and/or cocks are provided on the inlet side and outlet side of the oil fuel strainers; and </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.3.4 pipe joints of welded construction or of circular cone type or spherical type union joint are applied as much as possible; and</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.4 In cargo ships the use of fuel having a lower flashpoint than otherwise specified in paragraph 2.1, for example crude oil, may be permitted provided that such fuel is not stored in any machinery space and subject to the approval by the Administration of the complete installation. </H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.2 Arrangements for oil fuel</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>In a ship in which oil fuel is used, the arrangements for the storage, distribution and utilization of the oil fuel shall be such as to ensure the safety of the ship and persons on board and shall at least comply with the following provisions. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>2.2.1 Location of oil fuel systems </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>As far as practicable, parts of the oil fuel system containing heated oil under pressure exceeding 0.18 N/mmÂ² shall not be placed in a concealed position such that defects and leakage cannot readily be observed. The machinery spaces in way of such parts of the oil fuel system shall be adequately illuminated. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>2.2.2 Ventilation of machinery spaces </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>The ventilation of machinery spaces shall be sufficient under normal conditions to prevent accumulation of oil vapour. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>2.2.3 Oil fuel tanks </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.3.1 Fuel oil, lubrication oil and other flammable oils shall not be carried in forepeak tanks. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.3.2 As far as practicable, oil fuel tanks shall be part of the ships structure and shall be located outside machinery spaces of category A. Where oil fuel tanks, other than double bottom tanks, are necessarily located adjacent to or within machinery spaces of category A, at least one of their vertical sides shall be contiguous to the machinery space boundaries, and shall preferably have a common boundary with the double bottom tanks, and the area of the tank boundary common with the machinery spaces shall be kept to a minimum.* Where such tanks are situated within the boundaries of machinery spaces of category A they shall not contain oil fuel having a flashpoint of less than 60 degrees C . In general, the use of free-standing oil fuel tanks shall be avoided. When such tanks are employed their use shall be prohibited in category A machinery spaces on passenger ships. Where permitted, they shall be placed in an oil-tight spill tray of ample size having a suitable drain pipe leading to a suitably sized spill oil tank. </H6>

<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.3.3 No oil fuel tank shall be situated where spillage or leakage therefrom can constitute a fire or explosion hazard by falling on heated surfaces. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.3.4 Oil fuel pipes, which, if damaged, would allow oil to escape from a storage, settling or daily service tank having a capacity of 500 <EM>l</EM> and above situated above the double bottom, shall be fitted with a cock or valve directly on the tank capable of being closed from a safe position outside the space concerned in the event of a fire occurring in the space in which such tanks are situated. In the special case of deep tanks situated in any shaft or pipe tunnel or similar space, valves on the tank shall be fitted, but control in the event of fire may be effected by means of an additional valve on the pipe or pipes outside the tunnel or similar space. If such an additional valve is fitted in the machinery space it shall be operated from a position outside this space. The controls for remote operation of the valve for the emergency generator fuel tank shall be in a separate location from the controls for remote operation of other valves for tanks located in machinery spaces. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.3.5 Safe and efficient means of ascertaining the amount of oil fuel contained in any oil fuel tank shall be provided. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>2.2.3.5.1 Where sounding pipes are used, they shall not terminate in any space where the risk of ignition of spillage from the sounding pipe might arise. In particular, they shall not terminate in passenger or crew spaces. As a general rule, they shall not terminate in machinery spaces. However, where the Administration considers that these latter requirements are impracticable, it may permit termination of sounding pipes in machinery spaces on condition that all of the following requirements are met: </H6>
<H6 class=body5 align=justify>.1 an oil-level gauge is provided meeting the requirements of paragraph 2.2.3.5.2;</H6>
<H6 class=body5 align=justify>.2 the sounding pipes terminate in locations remote from ignition hazards unless precautions are taken, such as the fitting of effective screens, to prevent the oil fuel in the case of spillage through the terminations of the sounding pipes from coming into contact with a source of ignition; and</H6>
<H6 class=body5 align=justify>.3 the termination of sounding pipes are fitted with self-closing blanking devices and with a small-diameter self-closing control cock located below the blanking device for the purpose of ascertaining before the blanking device is opened that oil fuel is not present. Provisions shall be made so as to ensure that any spillage of oil fuel through the control cock involves no ignition hazard.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>2.2.3.5.2 Other oil-level gauges may be used in place of sounding pipes subject to the following conditions: </H6>
<H6 class=body5 align=justify>.1 in passenger ships, such gauges shall not require penetration below the top of the tank and their failure or overfilling of the tanks shall not permit release of fuel; and</H6>
<H6 class=body5 align=justify>.2 in cargo ships, the failure of such gauges or overfilling of the tank shall not permit release of fuel into the space. The use of cylindrical gauge glasses is prohibited. The Administration may permit the use of oil-level gauges with flat glasses and self-closing valves between the gauges and fuel tanks.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>2.2.3.5.3 The means prescribed in paragraph 2.2.3.5.2 which are acceptable to the Administration shall be maintained in the proper condition to ensure their continued accurate functioning in service. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>2.2.4 Prevention of overpressure Provisions shall be made to prevent overpressure in any oil tank or in any part of the oil fuel system, including the filling pipes served by pumps on board. Air and overflow pipes and relief valves shall discharge to a position where there is no risk of fire or explosion from the emergence of oils and vapour and shall not lead into crew spaces, passenger spaces nor into special category spaces, closed ro-ro cargo spaces, machinery spaces or similar spaces. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>2.2.5 Oil fuel piping </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.5.1 Oil fuel pipes and their valves and fittings shall be of steel or other approved material, except that restricted use of flexible pipes shall be permissible in positions where the Administration is satisfied that they are necessary.* Such flexible pipes and end attachments shall be of approved fire-resisting materials of adequate strength and shall be constructed to the satisfaction of the Administration. For valves, fitted to oil fuel tanks and which are under static pressure, steel or spheroidal-graphite cast iron may be accepted. However, ordinary cast iron valves may be used in piping systems where the design pressure is lower than 7 bar and the design temperature is below 60 degrees C . </H6>

<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.5.2 External high-pressure fuel delivery lines between the high-pressure fuel pumps and fuel injectors shall be protected with a jacketed piping system capable of containing fuel from a high-pressure line failure. A jacketed pipe incorporates an outer pipe into which the high-pressure fuel pipe is placed, forming a permanent assembly. The jacketed piping system shall include a means for collection of leakages and arrangements and shall be provided with an alarm in case of a fuel line failure. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.5.3 Oil fuel lines shall not be located immediately above or near units of high temperature including boilers, steam pipelines, exhaust manifolds, silencers or other equipment required to be insulated by paragraph 2.2.6. As far as practicable, oil fuel lines shall be arranged far apart from hot surfaces, electrical installations or other sources of ignition and shall be screened or otherwise suitably protected to avoid oil spray or oil leakage onto the sources of ignition. The number of joints in such piping systems shall be kept to a minimum. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.5.4 Components of a diesel engine fuel system shall be designed considering the maximum peak pressure which will be experienced in service, including any high pressure pulses which are generated and transmitted back into the fuel supply and spill lines by the action of fuel injection pumps. Connections within the fuel supply and spill lines shall be constructed having regard to their ability to prevent pressurized oil fuel leaks while in service and after maintenance. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.5.5 In multi-engine installations which are supplied from the same fuel source, means of isolating the fuel supply and spill piping to individual engines, shall be provided. The means of isolation shall not affect the operation of the other engines and shall be operable from a position not rendered inaccessible by a fire on any of the engines. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.5.6 Where the Administration may permit the conveying of oil and combustible liquids through accommodation and service spaces, the pipes conveying oil or combustible liquids shall be of a material approved by the Administration having regard to the fire risk. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>2.2.6 Protection of high temperature surfaces </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.6.1 Surfaces with temperatures above 220 degrees C which may be impinged as a result of a fuel system failure shall be properly insulated. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>2.2.6.2 Precautions shall be taken to prevent any oil that may escape under pressure from any pump, filter or heater from coming into contact with heated surfaces. </H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.3 Arrangements for lubricating oil </H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>2.3.1 The arrangements for the storage, distribution and utilization of oil used in pressure lubrication systems shall be such as to ensure the safety of the ship and persons on board. The arrangements made in machinery spaces of category A, and whenever practicable in other machinery spaces, shall at least comply with the provisions of paragraphs 2.2.1, 2.2.3.3, 2.2.3.4, 2.2.3.5, 2.2.4, 2.2.5.1, 2.2.5.3, and 2.2.6 except that: <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=142&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 38</A></H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.1 this does not preclude the use of sight-flow glasses in lubricating systems provided that they are shown by testing to have a suitable degree of fire resistance; and </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.2 sounding pipes may be authorized in machinery spaces; however, the requirements of paragraphs 2.2.3.5.1.1 and 2.2.3.5.1.3 need not be applied on condition that the sounding pipes are fitted with appropriate means of closure; </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>2.3.2 The provisions of paragraph 2.2.3.4 shall also apply to lubricating oil tanks except those having a capacity less than 500 l, storage tanks on which valves are closed during the normal operation mode of the ship, or where it is determined that an unintended operation of a quick closing valve on the oil lubricating tank would endanger the safe operation of the main propulsion and essential auxiliary machinery. </H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.4 Arrangements for other flammable oils </H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>The arrangements for the storage, distribution and utilization of other flammable oils employed under pressure in power transmission systems, control and activating systems and heating systems shall be such as to ensure the safety of the ship and persons on board. Suitable oil collecting arrangements for leaks shall be fitted below hydraulic valves and cylinders. In locations where means of ignition are present, such arrangements shall at least comply with the provisions of paragraphs 2.2.3.3, 2.2.3.5, 2.2.5.3 and 2.2.6 and with the provisions of paragraphs 2.2.4 and 2.2.5.1 in respect of strength and construction. </H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.5 Arrangements for oil fuel in periodically unattended machinery spaces </H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>In addition to the requirements of paragraphs 2.1 to 2.4, the oil fuel and lubricating oil systems in a periodically unattended machinery space shall comply with the following: </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 where daily service oil fuel tanks are filled automatically, or by remote control, means shall be provided to prevent overflow spillages. Other equipment which treats flammable liquids automatically (e.g. oil fuel purifiers) which, whenever practicable, shall be installed in a special space reserved for purifiers and their heaters, shall have arrangements to prevent overflow spillages; and </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 where daily service oil fuel tanks or settling tanks are fitted with heating arrangements, a high temperature alarm shall be provided if the flashpoint of the oil fuel can be exceeded. </H6></BODY></HTML>
