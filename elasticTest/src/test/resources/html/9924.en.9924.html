<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>For the purpose of this Chapter, unless expressly provided otherwise:</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(a) "Non-combustible material" means a material which neither burns nor gives off inflammable vapours in sufficient quantity for self-ignition when heated to approximately 750°C (1,382°F) this being determined to the satisfaction of the Administration by an established test procedure*. Any other material is a combustible material.</H4>

The specimen shall have an exposed surface of not less than 4.65 square metres (50 square feet) and height (or length of deck) of 2.44 metres (8 feet) resembling as closely as possible the intended construction and including where appropriate at least one joint. The standard time-temperature curve is defined by a smooth curve drawn through the following points:</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>at the end of the first 5 minutes - 538°C(1,000˚F)</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>at the end of the first 10 minutes - 704°C(1,300˚F)</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>at the end of the first 30 minutes - 843°C(1,550˚F)</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>at the end of the first 60 minutes - 927°C(1,700˚F)</H5>

<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) they shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material;</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) they shall be suitably stiffened;</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(iii) they shall be so constructed as to be capable of preventing the passage of smoke and flame to the end of the one-hour standard fire test;</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(iv) they shall be insulated with approved non-combustible materials such that the average temperature of the unexposed side will not rise more than 13 9°C (250 °F) above the original temperature, nor will the temperature, at any one point, including any joint, rise more than 180°C (325 °F) above the original temperature, within the time listed below :</H5>
