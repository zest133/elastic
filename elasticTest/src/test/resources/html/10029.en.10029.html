<H3 class=regulation align=center>Arrangements for Oil Fuel, Lubricating Oil and other Inflammable Oils</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Oil Fuel Arrangements</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>In a ship in which oil fuel is used, the arrangements for the storage, distribution and utilization of the oil fuel shall be such as to ensure the safety of the ship and persons on board and shall at least comply with the following provisions:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(i) No oil fuel which has a flashpoint of less than 60°C (140°F) (closed cup test) as determined by an approved flashpoint apparatus shall be used as fuel, except in emergency generators, in which case the flashpoint shall be not less than 43°C (110°F). Provided that the Administration may permit the general use of fuel oil having a flashpoint of not less than 43°C(110°F) subject to such additional precautions as it may consider necessary and on condition that the temperature of the space in which such fuel is stored or used shall not be allowed to rise within 10°C(18°F) below the flashpoint of the fuel.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(ii) As far as practicable, no part of the oil fuel system containing heated oil under pressure exceeding 1.8 kilogrammes per square centimetre (25 pounds per square inch) gauge shall be so concealed that defects and leakage cannot readily be observed. In way of such parts of the oil fuel system the machinery space shall be adequately illuminated.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(iii) The ventilation of machinery spaces shall be sufficient under all normal conditions to prevent accumulation of oil vapour.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(iv)</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>(1) As far as practicable, oil fuel tanks shall be part of the ship's structure and shall be located outside machinery spaces of Category A. When oil fuel tanks, except double bottom tanks, are necessarily located adjacent to machinery spaces of Category A, they shall preferably have a common boundary with the double bottom tanks, and the area of the tank boundary common with the machinery space shall be kept to a minimum. In general, the use of free-standing oil fuel tanks shall be avoided but when such tanks are employed they shall not be situated in machinery spaces of Category A.</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>(2) No oil tank shall be situated where spillage or leakage therefrom can constitute a hazard by falling on heated surfaces. Precautions shall be taken to prevent any oil that may escape under pressure from any pump, filter or heater from coming into contact with heated surfaces.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(v) Every oil fuel pipe which if damaged would allow oil to escape from a storage, settling or daily service tank situated above the double bottom shall be fitted with a cock or valve on the tank capable of being closed from a safe position outside the space concerned in the event of a fire arising in the space in which such tanks are situated. In the special case of deep tanks situated in any shaft or pipe tunnel or similar space, valves on the tanks shall be fitted but control in event of fire may be effected by means of an additional valve on the pipe or pipes outside the tunnel or similar space.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(vi) Safe and efficient means of ascertaining the amount of oil fuel contained in any oil tank shall be provided. Sounding pipes with suitable means of closure may be permitted if their upper ends terminate in safe positions. Other means of ascertaining the amount of oil fuel contained in any oil fuel tank may be permitted if they do not require penetration below the top of the tank, and providing their failure or over filling of the tanks will not permit release of fuel thereby.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(vii) Provision shall be made to prevent over-pressure in any oil tank or in any part of the oil fuel system, including the filling pipes. Any relief valves and air or overflow pipes shall discharge to a position which, in the opinion of the Administration, is safe.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(viii) Oil fuel pipes shall be of steel or other approved material, provided that restricted use of flexible pipes shall be permissible in positions where the Administration is satisfied that they are necessary. Such flexible pipes and end attachments shall be of approved fire-resisting materials of adequate strength and shall be constructed to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Lubricating Oil Arrangements.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>The arrangements for the storage, distribution and utilization of oil used in pressure lubrication systems shall be such as to ensure the safety of the ships and persons on board, and such arrangements in machinery spaces of Category A and, whenever practicable, in other machinery spaces shall at least comply with the provisions of sub-paragraphs (ii), (iv)(2), (v), (vi) and (vii) of paragraph (a) of this Regulation.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Arrangements for other Inflammable Oils.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>The arrangements for the storage, distribution and utilization of other inflammable oils employed under pressure in power transmission systems, control and activating systems and heating systems shall be such as to ensure the safety of the ship and persons on board. In locations where means of ignition are present such arrangements shall at least comply with the provisions of sub- paragraphs (a)(iv)(2) and (a)(vi), and with the provisions of sub-paragraph (a)(viii) in respect of strength and construction, of this Regulation.</H5></BODY></HTML>
