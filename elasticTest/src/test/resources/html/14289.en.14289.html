    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">1 A forepeak or collision bulkhead shall be fitted which shall be watertight up to the bulkhead deck. This bulkhead shall be located at a distance from the forward perpendicular of not less than 5% of the length of the ship and not more than 3m plus 5% of the length of the ship.</H4>
    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">2 Where any part of the ship below the waterline extends forward of the forward perpendicular, e.g. a bulbous bow, the distances stipulated in paragraph 1 shall be measured from a point either:</H4>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">.1 at the mid-length of such extension; or</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">.2 at a distance 1.5% of the length of the ship forward of the forward perpendicular; or</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">.3 at a distance 3m forward of the forward perpendicular;whichever gives the smallest measurement.</H5>
    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">3 Where a long forward superstructure is fitted, the forepeak or collision bulkhead on all passenger ships shall be extended weathertight to the next full deck above the bulkhead deck. The extension shall be so arranged as to preclude the possibility of the bow door causing damage to it in the case of damage to, or detachment of, a bow door.</H4>
    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">4 The extension required in paragraph 3 need not be fitted directly above the bulkhead below, provided that all parts of the extension are not located forward of the forward limit specified in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2. However, in ships constructed before 1 July 1997:</H4>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">.1 where a sloping ramp forms part of the extension, the part of the extension, which is more than 2.3m above the bulkhead deck, may extend no more than 1m forward of the forward limits specified in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2;and</H5>
    <H5 CLASS="body1" ALIGN="justify">.2 where the existing ramp does not comply with the requirements for acceptance as an extension to the collision bulkhead and the position of the ramp prevents the siting of such extension within the limits specified in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, the extension may be sited within a limited distance aft of the aft limit specified in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2. The limited distance aft should be no more than is necessary to ensure non interference with the ramp. The extension to the collision bulkhead shall open forward and comply with the requirements of paragraph 3 and shall be so arranged as to preclude the possibility of the ramp causing damage to it in the case of damage to, or detachment of, the ramp.</H5>
    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">5 Ramps not meeting the above requirements shall be disregarded as an extension of the collision bulkhead.</H4>
    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">6 In ships constructed before 1 July 1997, the requirements of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall apply not later than the date of the first periodical survey after 1 July 1997.</H4>
    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">7 An afterpeak bulkhead, and bulkheads dividing the machinery space, as defined in regulation 2, from the cargo and passenger spaces forward and aft, shall also be fitted and made watertight up to the bulkhead deck, The afterpeak bulkhead may, however, be stepped below the bulkhead deck, provided the degree of safety of the ship as regards subdivision is not thereby diminished.</H4>
    <H4 CLASS="subtitle" ALIGN="left">8 In all cases stern tubes shall be enclosed in watertight spaces of moderate volume. The stern gland shall be situated in a watertight shaft tunnel or other watertight space separate from the stern tube compartment and of such volume that, if flooded by leakage through the stern gland, the margin line will not be submerged.</H4>
