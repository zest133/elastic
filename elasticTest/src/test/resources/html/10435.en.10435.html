<H4 class=subtitle align=left>All items of lifeboat equipment, with the exception of the boat hook which shall be kept free for fending off purposes, shall be suitably secured within the lifeboat. The lashing shall be carried out in such a manner as to ensure the security of the equipment and so as not to interfere with the lifting hooks or to prevent ready embarkation. All items of lifeboat equipment shall be as small and light in weight as possible and shall be packed in suitable and compact form.</H4></BODY></HTML>
