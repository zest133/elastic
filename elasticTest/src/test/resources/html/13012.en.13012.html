<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 A lifejacket shall not sustain burning or continue melting after being totally enveloped in a fire for a period of 2 s.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 A lifejacket shall be so constructed that:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 after demonstration, a person can correctly don it within a period of 1min without assistance;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 it is capable of being worn inside-out or is clearly capable of being worn in only one way and, as far as possible, cannot be donned incorrectly;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 it is comfortable to wear;</H6>

<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3 A lifejacket shall have sufficient buoyancy and stability in calm fresh water to:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 lift the mouth of an exhausted or unconscious person not less than 120 mm clear of the water with the body inclined backwards at an angle of not less than 20° and not more than 50°from the vertical position;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 turn the body of an unconscious person in the water from any position to one where the mouth is clear of the water in not more than 5 s.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.4 A lifejacket shall have buoyancy which is not reduced by more than 5% after 24 h submersion in fresh water.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.5 A lifejacket shall allow the person wearing it to swim a short distance and to board a survival craft.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.6 Each lifejacket shall be fitted with a whistle firmly secured by a cord.</H5>

<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 inflate automatically on immersion, be provided with a device to permit inflation by a single manual motion and be capable of being inflated by mouth;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 in the event of loss of buoyancy in any one compartment be capable of complying with the requirements of paragraphs 1.2, 1.3 and 1.5;</H5>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.1 Each lifejacket light shall:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 have a luminous intensity of not less than 0.75 cd;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 have a source of energy capable of providing a luminous intensity of 0.75 cd for a period of at least 8 h;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 be visible over as great a segment of the upper hemisphere as is practicable when attached to a lifejacket.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.2 If the light referred to in paragraph 3.1 is a flashing light it shall, in addition:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 be provided with a manually operated switch;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 not be fitted with a lens or curved reflector to concentrate the beam;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 flash at a rate of not less than 50 flashes per minute with an effective luminous intensity of at least 0.75 cd .</H5></BODY></HTML>
