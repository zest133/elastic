<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>7.2 Arrangement of ducts </H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>7.2.1 The ventilation systems for machinery spaces of category A, vehicle spaces, ro-ro spaces, galleys, special category spaces and cargo spaces shall, in general, be separated from each other and from the ventilation systems serving other spaces. Except that the galley ventilation systems on cargo ships of less than 4,000 gross tonnage and in passenger ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, need not be completely separated, but may be served by separate ducts from a ventilation unit serving other spaces. In any case, an automatic fire damper shall be fitted in the galley ventilation duct near the ventilation unit. Ducts provided for the ventilation of machinery spaces of category A, galleys, vehicle spaces, ro-ro spaces or special category spaces shall not pass through accommodation spaces, service spaces or control stations unless they comply with the conditions specified in paragraphs 7.2.1.1.1 to 7.2.1.1.4 or 7.2.1.2.1 and 7.2.1.2.2 below:</H6>

<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.1.1 the ducts are constructed of steel having a thickness of at least 3 mm and 5 mm for ducts the widths or diameters of which are up to and including 300 mm and 760 mm and over respectively and, in the case of such ducts, the widths or diameters of which are between 300 mm and 760 mm having a thickness obtained by interpolation; </H6>

<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>7.2.2 Ducts provided for ventilation to accommodation spaces, service spaces or control stations shall not pass through machinery spaces of category A, galleys, vehicle spaces, ro-ro spaces or special category spaces unless they comply with the conditions specified in paragraphs 7.2.2.1.1 to 7.2.2.1.3 or 7.2.2.2.1 and 7.2.2.2.2 below: </H6>
