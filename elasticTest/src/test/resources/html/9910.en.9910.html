<H3 class=regulation align=center>Precautions against Shock, Fire and other Hazards of Electrical Origin</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Passenger Ships and Cargo Ships.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i)</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) All exposed metal parts of electrical machines or equipment which are not intended to be "live" but are liable to become "live" under fault conditions, shall be earthed (grounded); and all electrical apparatus shall be so constructed and so installed that danger of injury in ordinary handling shall not exist.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) Metal frames of all portable electric lamps, tools and similar apparatus, supplied as ship's equipment and rated in excess of a safety voltage to be prescribed by the Administration shall be earthed (grounded) through a suitable conductor, unless equivalent provisions are made such as by double insulation or by an isolating transformer. The Administration may require additional special precautions for electric lamps, tools or similar apparatus for use in damp spaces.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Main and emergency switchboards shall be so arranged as to give easy access back and front, without danger to attendants. The sides and backs and, where necessary, the fronts of switchboards shall be suitably guarded. There shall be non-conducting mats or gratings front and rear where necessary. Exposed current-carrying parts at voltages to earth (ground) exceeding a voltage to be specified by the Administration shall not be installed on the face of any switchboard or control panel.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii)</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) Where the hull return system of distribution is used, special precautions shall be taken to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) Hull return shall not be used in tankers.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv)</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) All metal sheaths and armour of cables shall be electrically continuous and shall be earthed (grounded).</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) Where the cables are neither sheathed nor armoured and there might be a risk of fire in the event of an electrical fault, precautions shall be required by the Administration.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(v) Lighting fittings shall be arranged to prevent temperature rises that would be injurious to the wiring, and to prevent surrounding material from becoming excessively hot.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vi) Wiring shall be supported in such a manner as to avoid chafing or other injury.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vii) Each separate circuit shall be protected against short circuit. Each separate circuit shall also be protected against overload, except in accordance with Regulation 30 of this Chapter or where the Administration grants an exemption. The current-carrying capacity of each circuit shall be permanently indicated, together with the rating or setting of the appropriate overload protective device.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(viii) Accumulator batteries shall be suitably housed, and compartments used primarily for their accommodation shall be properly constructed and efficiently ventilated.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Passenger Ships only.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Distribution systems shall be so arranged that fire in any main fire zone will not interfere with essential services in any other main fire zone. This requirement will be met if main and emergency feeders passing through any zone are separated both vertically and horizontally as widely as is practicable.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Electric cables shall be of a flame retarding type to the satisfaction of the Administration. The Administration may require additional safeguards for electric cables in particular spaces of the ship with a view to the prevention of fire or explosion.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) In spaces where inflammable mixtures are liable to collect, no electrical equipment shall be installed unless it is of a type which will not ignite the mixture concerned, such as flameproof (explosion proof) equipment.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) A lighting circuit in a bunker or hold shall be provided with an isolating switch outside the space.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(v) Joints in all conductors except for low voltage communication circuits shall be made only in junction or outlet boxes. All such boxes or wiring devices shall be so constructed as to prevent the spread of fire from the box or device. Where splicing is employed it shall only be by an approved method such that it retains the original mechanical and electrical properties of the cable.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vi) Wiring systems for interior communications essential for safety and for emergency alarm systems shall be arranged to avoid galleys, machinery spaces and other enclosed spaces having a high risk of fire except in so far as it is necessary to provide communication or to give alarm within those spaces. In the case of ships the construction and small size of which do not permit of compliance with these requirements, measures satisfactory to the Administration shall be taken to ensure efficient protection for these wiring systems where they pass through galleys, machinery spaces and other enclosed spaces having a high risk of fire.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Cargo Ships only. Devices liable to arc shall not be installed in any compartment assigned principally to accumulator batteries unless the devices are flameproof (explosion proof).</H4></BODY></HTML>
