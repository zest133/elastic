<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fire-extinguishing arrangements in machinery spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Spaces containing oil-fired boilers or oil fuel units</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 Machinery spaces of category A containing oil-fired boilers or oil fuel units shall be provided with any one of the following fixed fire-extinguishing systems:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 a gas system complying with the provisions of Regulation 5;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 a high expansion foam system complying with the provisions of Regulation 9;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 a pressure water-spraying system complying with the provisions of Regulation 10. In each case if the engine and boiler rooms are not entirely separate, or if fuel oil can drain from the boiler room into the engine room, the combined engine and boiler rooms shall be considered as one compartment.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 There shall be in each boiler room at least one set of portable air-foam equipment complying with the provisions of Regulation 6.4.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3 There shall be at least two portable foam extinguishers or equivalent in each firing space in each boiler room and in each space in which a part of the oil fuel installation is situated. There shall be not less than one approved foam-type extinguisher of at least 135 ℓ capacity or equivalent in each boiler room. These extinguishers shall be provided with hoses on reels suitable for reaching any part of the boiler room. In the case of domestic boilers of less than 175Kwin cargo ships the Administration may consider relaxing the requirements of this paragraph.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.4 In each firing space there shall be a receptacle containing sand, sawdust impregnated with soda, or other approved dry material in such quantity as may be required by the Administration. An approved portable extinguisher may be substituted as an alternative.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Spaces containing internal combustion machinery</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Machinery spaces of category A containing internal combustion machinery shall be provided with:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 One of the fire-extinguishing systems required by paragraph 1.1.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 At least one set of portable air-foam equipment complying with the provisions of Regulation 6.4.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 In each such space approved foam type fire extinguishers, each of at least 45ℓ capacity or equivalent, sufficient in number to enable foam or its equivalent to be directed on to any part of the fuel and lubricating oil pressure systems, gearing and other fire hazards. In addition, there shall be provided a sufficient number of portable foam extinguishers or equivalent which shall be so located that no point in the space is more than 10 m walking distance from an extinguisher and that there are at least two such extinguishers in each such space. For smaller spaces of cargo ships the Administration may consider relaxing this requirement.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Spaces containing steam turbines or enclosed steam engines</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>In spaces containing steam turbines or enclosed steam engines used either for main propulsion or for other purposes when such machinery has in the aggregate a total power output of not less than 375Kwthere shall be provided:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 Approved foam fire extinguishers each of at least 45ℓ capacity or equivalent sufficient in number to enable foam or its equivalent to be directed on to any part of the pressure lubrication system, on to any part of the casings enclosing pressure lubricated parts of the turbines, engines or associated gearing, and any other fire hazards. However, such extinguishers shall not be required if protection at least equivalent to that required by this sub-paragraph is provided in such spaces by a fixed fire-extinguishing system fitted in compliance with paragraph 1.1.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 A sufficient number of portable foam extinguishers or equivalent which shall be so located that no point in the space is more than 10 m walking distance from an extinguisher and that there are at least two such extinguishers in each such space, except that such extinguishers shall not be required in addition to any provided in compliance with paragraph 1.3.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 One of the fire-extinguishing systems required by paragraph 1.1, where such spaces are periodically unattended.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Fire-extinguishing appliances in other machinery spaces </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Where, in the opinion of the Administration, a fire hazard exists in any machinery space for which no specific provisions for fire-extinguishing appliances are prescribed in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, there shall be provided in, or adjacent to, that space such a number of approved portable fire extinguishers or other means of fire extinction as the Administration may deem sufficient.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Fixed fire-extinguishing systems not required by this Chapter </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Where a fixed fire-extinguishing system not required by this Chapter is installed, such a system shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Machinery spaces of category A in passenger ships </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>In passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers each machinery space of category A shall be provided with at least two suitable water fog applicators.*</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* A water fog applicator might consist of a metal "L"-shaped pipe the long limb being about 2 m in length capable of being fitted to a fire hose and the short limb being about 250 mm in length fitted with a fixed water fog nozzle or capable of being fitted with a water spray nozzle.</H6></BODY></HTML>
