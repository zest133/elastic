<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Equipment and arrangements for pilot transfer which are installed on or after 1 January 1994 shall comply with the requirements of this regulation and due regard shall be paid to the standards adopted by the Organization.*</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Reference is made to the Recommendation on Pilot Transfer Arrangements adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7186&amp;localekey=en">A.667(16).</A></H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) Equipment and arrangements for pilot transfer which are provided on ships before 1 January 1994 shall at least comply with the requirements of regulation 17 in force prior to that date and due regard shall be paid to the standards adopted by the Organization prior to that date.**</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>** Reference is made to the Recommendation on Performance Standards for Mechanical Pilot Hoists adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=6992&amp;localekey=en">A.275(VIII)</A> and to the Recommendation on Arrangements for Embarking and Disembarking Pilots in Very Large Ships adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7047&amp;localekey=en">A.426(XI).</A></H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) Equipment and arrangements which are replaced after 1 January 1994 shall, in so far as is reasonable and practicable, comply with the requirements of this regulation.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) General</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) All arrangements used for pilot transfer shall efficiently fulfil their purpose of enabling pilots to embark and disembark safely. The appliances shall be kept clean, properly maintained and stowed and shall be regularly inspected to ensure that they are safe to use. They shall be used solely for the embarkation and disembarkation of personnel.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) The rigging of the pilot transfer arrangements and the embarkation and disembarkation of a pilot shall be supervised by a responsible officer having means of communication with the navigating bridge who shall also arrange for the escort of the pilot by a safe route to and from the navigating bridge. Personnel engaged in rigging and operating any mechanical equipment shall be instructed in the safe procedures to be adopted and the equipment shall be tested prior to use.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Transfer arrangements</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Arrangements shall be provided to enable the pilot to embark and disembark safely on either side of the ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) In all ships where the distance from sea level to the point of access to, or egress from, the ship exceeds 9m, and when it is intended to embark and disembark pilots by means of the accommodation ladder, or by means of mechanical pilot hoists or other equally safe and convenient means in conjunction with a pilot ladder, the ship shall carry such equipment on each side, unless the equipment is capable of being transferred for use on either side.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) Safe and convenient access to, and egress from, the ship shall be provided by either:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) a pilot ladder requiring a climb of not less than 1.5m and not more than 9m above the surface of the water so positioned and secured that:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>(aa) it is clear of any possible discharges from the ship;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>(bb) it is within the parallel body length of the ship and, as far as is practicable, within the mid-ship half length of the ship;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>(cc) each step rests firmly against the ship's side; where constructional features, such as rubbing bands, would prevent the implementation of this provision, special arrangements shall, to the satisfaction of the Administration, be made to ensure that persons are able to embark and disembark safely;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>(dd) the single length of pilot ladder is capable of reaching the water from the point of access to, or egress from, the ship and due allowance is made for all conditions of loading and trim of the ship, and for an adverse list of 15?; the securing strongpoints, shackles and securing ropes shall be at least as strong as the side ropes;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) an accommodation ladder in conjunction with the pilot ladder, or other equally safe and convenient means, whenever the distance from the surface of the water to the point of access to the ship is more than 9m. The accommodation ladder shall be sited leading aft. When in use, the lower end of the accommodation ladder shall rest firmly against the ship's side within the parallel body length of the ship and, as far as is practicable, within the mid-ship half length and clear of all discharges; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(3) a mechanical pilot hoist so located that it is within the parallel body length of the ship and, as far as is practicable, within the mid-ship half length of the ship and clear of all discharges.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) Access to the ship's deck</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Means shall be provided to ensure safe, convenient and unobstructed passage for any person embarking on, or disembarking from, the ship between the head of the pilot ladder, or of any accommodation ladder or other appliance, and the ship's deck. Where such passage is by means of:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) a gateway in the rails or bulwark, adequate handholds shall be provided;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) a bulwark ladder, two handhold stanchions rigidly secured to the ship's structure at or near their bases and at higher points shall be fitted. The bulwark ladder shall be securely attached to the ship to prevent overturning.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) Shipside doors</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Shipside doors used for pilot transfer shall not open outwards.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) Mechanical pilot hoists</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The mechanical pilot hoist and its ancillary equipment shall be of a type approved by the Administration. The pilot hoist shall be designed to operate as a moving ladder to lift and lower one person on the side of the ship, or as a platform to lift and lower one or more persons on the side of the ship. It shall be of such design and construction as to ensure that the pilot can be embarked and disembarked in a safe manner, including a safe access from the hoist to the deck and vice versa. Such access shall be gained directly by a platform securely guarded by handrails.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Efficient hand gear shall be provided to lower or recover the person or persons carried, and kept ready for use in the event of power failure.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii)The hoist shall be securely attached to the structure of the ship. Attachment shall not be solely by means of the ship's side rails. Proper and strong attachment points shall be provided for hoists of the portable type on each side of the ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) If belting is fitted in the way of the hoist position, such belting shall be cut back sufficiently to allow the hoist to operate against the ship's side.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(v) A pilot ladder shall be rigged adjacent to the hoist and available for immediate use so that access to it is available from the hoist at any point of its travel. The pilot ladder shall be capable of reaching the sea level from its own point of access to the ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vi)The position on the ship's side where the hoist will be lowered shall be indicated.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vii)An adequate protected stowage position shall be provided for the portable hoist. In very cold weather, to avoid the danger of ice formation, the portable hoist shall not be rigged until its use is imminent.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) Associated equipment</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The following associated equipment shall be kept at hand ready for immediate use when persons are being transferred:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) two man-ropes of not less than 28 mm in diameter properly secured to the ship if required by the pilot;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) a lifebuoy equipped with a self-igniting light;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(3) a heaving line.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) When required by paragraph (d), stanchions and bulwark ladders shall be provided.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) Lighting</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Adequate lighting shall be provided to illuminate the transfer arrangements overside, the position on deck where a person embarks or disembarks and the controls of the mechanical pilot hoist.</H4></BODY></HTML>
