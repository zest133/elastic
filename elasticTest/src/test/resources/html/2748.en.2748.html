<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Structural and other requirements for bulk carriers</H3>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1 Bulk carriers of 150 m in length and upwards of single-side skin construction, carrying solid bulk cargoes having a density of 1,780 kg/m3 and above, constructed before 1 July 1999, shall comply with the following requirements in accordance with the implementation schedule specified in regulation 3:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 The transverse watertight bulkhead between the two foremost cargo holds and the double bottom of the foremost cargo hold shall have sufficient strength to withstand flooding of the foremost cargo hold, taking also into account dynamic effects resulting from the presence of water in the hold, in compliance with the Bulk carrier bulkhead and double bottom strength standards. For the purpose of this regulation, the Bulk carrier bulkhead and double bottom strength standards shall be treated as mandatory.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 In considering the need for, and the extent of, strengthening of the transverse watertight bulkhead or double bottom to meet the requirements of 1.1, the following restrictions may be taken into account:</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.1 restrictions on the distribution of the total cargo weight between the cargo holds; and</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.2 restrictions on the maximum deadweight.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.3 For bulk carriers using either of, or both, the restrictions given in 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 above for the purpose of fulfilling the requirements of 1.1, these restrictions shall be complied with whenever solid bulk cargoes having a density of 1,780 kg/m3 and above are carried.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2 Bulk carriers of 150 m in length and upwards constructed on or after 1 July 2006, in all areas with double-side skin construction shall comply with the following requirements: <IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">&nbsp;<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=43488&amp;localekey=en">IACS UI SC 210</A></H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 Primary stiffening structures of the double-side skin shall not be placed inside the cargo hold space.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 Subject to the provisions below, the distance between the outer shell and the inner shell at any transverse section shall not be less than 1,000 mm measured perpendicular to the side shell. The double-side skin construction shall be such as to allow access for inspection as provided in regulation II-1/3-6 and the Technical Provisions referring thereto.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.1 The clearances below need not be maintained in way of cross ties, upper and lower end brackets of transverse framing or end brackets of longitudinal framing.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.2 The minimum width of the clear passage through the double-side skin space in way of obstructions such as piping or vertical ladders shall not be less than 600 mm.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.3 Where the inner and/or outer skins are transversely framed, the minimum clearance between the inner surfaces of the frames shall not be less than 600 mm.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.4 Where the inner and outer skins are longitudinally framed, the minimum clearance between the inner surfaces of the frames shall not be less than 800 mm. Outside the parallel part of the cargo hold length, this clearance may be reduced where necessitated by the structural configuration, but, in no case, shall be less than 600 mm.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.5 The minimum clearance referred to above shall be the shortest distance measured between assumed lines connecting the inner surfaces of the frames on the inner and outer skins.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3 Double-side skin spaces and dedicated seawater ballast tanks arranged in bulk carriers of 150 m in length and upwards constructed on or after 1 July 2006 shall be coated in accordance with the requirements of regulation II-1/3-2 and also based on the Performance standards for coatings* to be adopted by the Organization.</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=footnote>* Refer to the standards acceptable to the Administration until such time that Performance standards for coating, to be adopted by the Organization, will be made mandatory by suitably modifying the above requirements.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4 The double-side skin spaces, with the exception of top-side wing tanks, if fitted, shall not be used for the carriage of cargo.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>5 In bulk carriers of 150 m in length and upwards, carrying solid bulk cargoes having a density of 1,000 kg/m3 and above, constructed on or after 1 July 2006:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 the structure of cargo holds shall be such that all contemplated cargoes can be loaded and discharged by standard loading/discharge equipment and procedures without damage which may compromise the safety of the structure;</H6>

<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 effective continuity between the side shell structure and the rest of the hull structure shall be assured; and</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.3 the structure of cargo areas shall be such that single failure of one stiffening structural member will not lead to immediate consequential failure of other structural items potentially leading to the collapse of the entire stiffened panels.</H6>
