<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 30</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Openings in "A" class divisions</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Except for hatches between cargo, special category, store, and baggage spaces, and between such spaces and the weather decks, all openings shall be provided with permanently attached means of closing which shall be at least as effective for resisting fires as the divisions in which they are fitted.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The construction of all doors and door frames in "A" class divisions, with the means of securing them when closed, shall provide resistance to fire as well as to the passage of smoke and flame, as far as practicable, equivalent to that of the bulkheads in which the doors are situated. Such doors and door frames shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material. Watertight doors need not be insulated.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 It shall be possible for each door to be opened and closed from each side of the bulkhead by one person only.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Fire doors in main vertical zone bulkheads and stairway enclosures shall satisfy the following requirements:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 The doors shall be self-closing and be capable of closing with an angle of inclination of up to 3.5 degrees opposing closure, and shall have an approximately uniform rate of closure of no more than 40 s and no less than 10 s with the ship in the upright position.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 Remote-controlled sliding or power-operated doors shall be equipped with an alarm that sounds at least 5 s but no more than 10 s before the door begins to move and continue sounding until the door is completely closed. Doors designed to re-open upon contacting an object in its path shall re-open sufficiently to allow a clear passage of at least 0.75 m, but no more than 1 m.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 All doors shall be capable of remote and automatic release from a continuously manned central control station, either simultaneously or in groups, and also individually from a position at both sides of the door. Indication must be provided at the fire control panel in the continuously manned central control station whether each of the remote-controlled doors are closed. The release mechanism shall be so designed that the door will automatically close in the event of disruption of the control system or central power supply. Release switches shall have an on-off function to prevent automatic resetting of the system. Hold-back hooks not subject to central control station release are prohibited.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 Local power accumulators for power-operated doors shall be provided in the immediate vicinity of the doors to enable the doors to be operated at least ten times (fully opened and closed) using the local controls.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 Double-leaf doors equipped with a latch necessary to their fire integrity shall have a latch that is automatically activated by the operation of the doors when released by the system.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 Doors giving direct access to special category spaces which are power-operated and automatically closed need not be equipped with alarms and remote-release mechanisms required in .2 and .3.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 In ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, where a space is protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of regulation 12 or fitted with a continuous "B" class ceiling, openings in decks not forming steps in main vertical zones nor bounding horizontal zones shall be closed reasonably tight and such decks shall meet the "A" class integrity requirements in so far as is reasonable and practicable in the opinion of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 The requirements for "A" class integrity of the outer boundaries of a ship shall not apply to glass partitions, windows and side scuttles provided that there is no requirement for such boundaries to have "A" class integrity in regulation 33.3. Similarly, the requirements for "A" class integrity shall not apply to exterior doors in superstructures and deck houses.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 All "A" class doors located in stairways, public spaces and main vertical zone bulkheads in escape routes shall be equipped with a self-closing hose port of material, construction and fire resistance which is equivalent to the door into which it is fitted, and shall be a 150 mm square clear opening with the door closed and shall be inset into the lower edge of the door, opposite the door hinges, or in the case of sliding doors, nearest the opening.</H4>
