<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) No certificate shall be extended under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this regulation for a longer period than five months, and a ship to which an extension is granted shall not, on its arrival in the State whose flag it is entitled to fly or the port in which it is to be surveyed, be entitled by virtue of such extension to leave that port or State without having obtained a new certificate.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) A certificate, other than that referred to in paragraph (b) of this regulation, which has not been extended under the foregoing provisions of this regulation, may be extended by the Administration for a period of grace up to one month from the date of expiry stated on it.</H4>
