<H3 class=regulation align=center>Ventilation systems</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 The ventilation system of a passenger ship carrying more than 36 passengers shall, in addition to this part of this Regulation, also be in compliance with the requirements of regulation 16.2 to 16.6, 16.8 and 16.9.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 In general, the ventilation fans shall be so disposed that the ducts reaching the various spaces remain within the main vertical zone.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3 Where ventilation systems penetrate decks, precautions shall be taken, in addition to those relating to the fire integrity of the deck required by Regulations 18.1.1 and 30.5, to reduce the likelihood of smoke and hot gases passing from one 'tween-deck space to another through the system. In addition to insulation requirements contained in this Regulation, vertical ducts shall, if necessary, be insulated as required by the appropriate tables in regulation 26.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.4 Except in cargo spaces, ventilation ducts shall be constructed of the following materials:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 ducts not less than 0.075m²in sectional area and all vertical ducts serving more than a single 'tween-deck space shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 ducts less than 0.075m²in sectional area other than the vertical ducts referred to in paragraph 1.4.1, shall be constructed of non-combustible materials. Where such ducts penetrate "A" or "B" class divisions due regard shall be given to ensuring the fire integrity of the division;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 short lengths of duct, not in general exceeding 0.02m²in sectional area nor 2 m in length, need not be non-combustible provided that all of the following conditions are met:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3.1 the duct is constructed of a material of low fire risk to the satisfaction of the Administration;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3.2 the duct is used only at the terminal end of the ventilation system; and</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3.3 the duct is not located closer than 600 mm measured along its length to a penetration of an "A" or "B" class division, including continuous "B" class ceilings.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.5 Stairway enclosures shall be ventilated and shall be served only by an independent fan and duct system which shall not serve any other spaces in the ventilation system.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.6 All power ventilation, except machinery space and cargo space ventilation an any alternative system which may be required under regulation 16.6, shall be fitted with controls so grouped that all fans may be stopped from either of two separate positions which shall be situated as far apart as practicable. Controls provided for the power ventilation serving machinery spaces shall also be grouped so as to be operable from two positions, one of which shall be outside such spaces. Fans serving power ventilation systems to cargo spaces shall be capable of being stopped from a safe position outside such spaces.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.7 Where public spaces span three or more open decks and contain combustibles such as furniture and enclosed spaces such as shops, offices and restaurants, the space shall be equipped with a smoke extraction system. The smoke extraction system shall be activated by the required smoke detection system and be capable of manual control. The fans shall be sized such that the entire volume within the space can be exhausted in 10 min or less.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.8 Ventilation ducts shall be provided with suitably located hatches for inspection and cleaning, where reasonable and practicable.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.9 Exhaust ducts from galley ranges in which grease or fat is likely to accumulate shall meet requirements of regulation II-2/16.3.2.1 and 16.3.2.2 and shall be fitted with:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 a grease trap readily removable for cleaning unless an alternative approved grease removal system is fitted;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 a fire damper located in the lower end of the duct which is automatically and remotely operated, and in addition a remotely operated fire damper located in the upper end of the duct;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 a fixed means for extinguishing a fire within the duct;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 remote control arrangements for shutting off the exhaust fans and supply fans, for operating the fire dampers mentioned in .2 and for operating the fire-extinguishing system, which shall be placed in a position close to the entrance to the galley. Where a multi-branch system is installed, means shall be provided to close all branches exhausting through the same main duct before an extinguishing medium is released into the system; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 suitably located hatches for inspection and cleaning.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Passenger ships carrying not more than 36 passengers.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 The ventilation system of passenger ships carrying not more than 36 passengers shall be in compliance with regulation 16.</H5></BODY></HTML>
