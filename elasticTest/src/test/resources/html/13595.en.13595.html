<H3 class=regulation align=center>Radio equipment - Sea areas A1, A2 and A3</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 In addition to meeting the requirements of regulation 7, every ship engaged on voyages beyond sea areas A1 and A2, but remaining within sea area A3, shall, if it does not comply with the requirements of paragraph 2, be provided with :</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 an INMARSAT ship earth station capable of:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.1 transmitting and receiving distress and safety communications using direct-printing telegraphy;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.2 initiating and receiving distress priority calls;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.3 maintaining watch for shore-to-ship distress alerts, including those directed to specifically defined geographical areas;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.4 transmitting and receiving general radio communications, using either radiotelephony or direct-printing telegraphy; and</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 an MF radio installation capable of transmitting and receiving, for distress and safety purposes, on the frequencies:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.1 2,187.5kHz using DSC; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.2 2,182kHz using radiotelephony; and</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 a radio installation capable of maintaining a continuous DSC watch on the frequency 2,187.5kHz which may be separate from or combined with that required by subparagraph .2.1; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 means of initiating the transmission of ship-to-shore distress alerts by a radio service operating either:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4.1 through the polar orbiting satellite service on 406MHz; this requirement may be fulfilled by the satellite EPIRB, required by regulation 7.1.6, either by installing the satellite EPIRB close to, or by remote activation from, the position from which the ship is normally navigated; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4.2 on HF using DSC; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4.3 through the INMARSAT geostationary satellite service, by an additional ship earth station or by the satellite EPIRB required by regulation 7.1.6, either by installing the satellite EPIRB close to, or by remote activation from, the position from which the ship is normally navigated;</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 In addition to meeting the requirements of regulation 7, every ship engaged on voyages beyond sea areas A1 and A2, but remaining within sea area A3, shall, if it does not comply with the requirements of paragraph 1, be provided with:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 an MF/HF radio installation capable of transmitting and receiving, for distress and safety purposes, on all distress and safety frequencies in the bands between 1,605kHz and 4,000kHz and between 4,000kHz and 27,500kHz:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.1 using DSC;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.2 using radiotelephony; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.3 using direct-printing telegraphy; and</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 equipment capable of maintaining DSC watch on 2,187.5kHz, 8,414.5kHz and on at least one of the distress and safety DSC frequencies 4,207.5kHz, 6312kHz, 12,577 kHz or 16,804.5kHz; at any time, it shall be possible to select any of these DSC distress and safety frequencies. This equipment may be separate from, or combined with the equipment required by subparagraph .1; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 means of initiating the transmission of ship-to-shore distress alerts by a radio communication service other than HF operating either:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3.1 through the polar orbiting satellite service on 406 MHz; this requirement may be fulfilled by the satellite EPIRB, required by regulation 7.1.6, either by installing the satellite EPIRB close to, or by remote activation from, the position from which the ship is normally navigated; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3.2 through the INMARSAT geostationary satellite service; this Requirement may be fulfilled by:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3.2.1 an INMARSAT ship earth station; or</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3.2.2 the satellite EPIRB, required by regulation 7.1.6, either by installing the satellite EPIRB close to, or by remote activation from, the position from which the ship is normally navigated; and</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 in addition, ships shall be capable of transmitting and receiving general radio communications using radiotelephony or direct-printing telegraphy by an MF/HF radio installation operating on working frequencies in the bands between 1,605 kHz and 4,000kHz and between 4,000kHz and 27,500kHz. This requirement may be fulfilled by the addition of this capability in the equipment required by subparagraph .1</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 It shall be possible to initiate transmission of distress alerts by the radio installations specified in subparagraphs 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 2.1 and 2.3 from the position from which the ship is normally navigated.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 The Administration may exempt ships constructed before 1 February 1997, and engaged exclusively on voyages within sea areas A2 and A3, from the requirements of regulations 7.1.1.1 and 7.1.2 provided such ships maintain, when practicable, a continuous listening watch on VHF channel 16. This watch shall be kept at the position from which the ship is normally navigated.</H4>
