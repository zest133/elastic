<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.4.2 In general, the ventilation fans shall be so arranged that the ducts reaching the various spaces remain within a main vertical zone.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.4.3 Stairway enclosures shall be served by an independent ventilation fan and duct system (exhaust and supply) which shall not serve any other spaces in the ventilation systems.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.4.4 A duct, irrespective of its cross-section, serving more than one 'tween-deck accommodation space, service space or control station, shall be fitted, near the penetration of each deck of such spaces, with an automatic smoke damper that shall also be capable of being closed manually from the protected deck above the damper. Where a fan serves more than one 'tween-deck space through separate ducts within a main vertical zone, each dedicated to a single 'tween-deck space, each duct shall be provided with a manually operated smoke damper fitted close to the fan.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>7.4.5 Vertical ducts shall, if necessary, be insulated as required by tables 9.1 and 9.2. Ducts shall be insulated as required for decks between the space they serve and the space being considered, as applicable.</U></H6>
