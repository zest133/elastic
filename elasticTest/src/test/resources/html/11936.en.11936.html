<H3 class=regulation align=center>Definitions</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>For the purpose of this Chapter, unless expressly provided otherwise:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 "Subdivision load line" is a water-line used in determining the subdivision of the ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 "Deepest subdivision load line" is the water-line which corresponds to the greatest draught permitted by the subdivision requirements which are applicable.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2 "Length of the ship" is the length measured between perpendiculars taken at the extremities of the deepest subdivision load line.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3 "Breadth of the ship" is the extreme width from outside of frame to outside of frame at or below the deepest subdivision load line.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4 "Draught" is the vertical distance from the moulded base line amidships to the subdivision load line in question.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5 "Bulkhead deck" is the uppermost deck up to which the transverse watertight bulkheads are carried.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6 "Margin line" is a line drawn at least 76 mm below the upper surface of the bulkhead deck at side.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7 "Permeability of a space" is the percentage of that space which can be occupied by water. The volume of a space which extends above the margin line shall be measured only to the height of that line.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>8 "Machinery space" is to be taken as extending from the moulded base line to the margin line and between the extreme main transverse watertight bulkheads, bounding the spaces containing the main and auxiliary propulsion machinery, boilers serving the needs of propulsion, and all permanent coal bunkers. In the case of unusual arrangements, the Administration may define the limits of the machinery spaces.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>9 "Passenger spaces" are those spaces which are provided for the accommodation and use of passengers, excluding baggage, store, provision and mail rooms. For the purposes of Regulations 5 and 6, spaces provided below the margin line for the accommodation and use of the crew shall be regarded as passenger spaces.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>10 In all cases volumes and areas shall be calculated to moulded lines.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>11 "Weather tight" means that in any sea conditions water will not penetrate into the ship.</H5></BODY></HTML>
