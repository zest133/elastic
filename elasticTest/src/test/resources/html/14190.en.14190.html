<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1 "Non-combustible material"* is a material which neither burns nor gives off flammable vapours in sufficient quantity for self-ignition when heated to approximately 750°C, this being determined to the satisfaction of the Administration by an established test procedure.** Any other material is a combustible material.</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* If a material passes the test as specified in resolution A.270(VIII) it should be considered as "non-combustible" even if it consists of a mixture of inorganic and organic substances.(Interpretation approved by the Maritime Safety Committee at its forty-sixth session. SLS.14/Circ.17)</H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>** Reference is made to Improved Recommendation on Test Method for Qualifying Marine Construction Materials as Non-Combustible, adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7068&amp;localekey=en">A.472(XII).</A></H6>
