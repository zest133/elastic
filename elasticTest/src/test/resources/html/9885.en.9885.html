<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Regulation 14</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>Openings in the Shell Plating below the Margin Line</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(a) The number of openings in the shell plating shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(b) The arrangement and efficiency of the means of closing any openings in the shell plating shall be consistent with its intended purpose and the position in which it is fitted and generally to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(c)</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) If in a between decks, the sills of any sidescuttles are below a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point 2½ per cent of the breadth of the ship above the deepest subdivision load line, all sidescuttles in that between deck shall be of the non-opening type.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) All sidescuttles the sills of which are below the margin line, other than those required to be of a non-opening type by sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph, shall be of such construction as will effectively prevent any person opening them without the consent of the master of the ship.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(iii)</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(1) Where in a between decks, the sills of any of the sidescuttles referred to in sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph are below a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point 1.37 metres (4½ feet) plus 2½ per cent of the breadth of the ship above the water when the ship departs from any port, all the sidescuttles in that between decks shall be closed watertight and locked before the ship leaves port, and they shall not be opened before the ship arrives at the next port. In the application of this sub-paragraph the appropriate allowance for fresh water may be made when applicable.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(2) The time of opening such sidescuttles in port and of closing and locking them before the ship leaves port shall be entered in such log book as may be prescribed by the Administration.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(3) For any ship that has one or more sidescuttles so placed that the requirements of clause (1) of this sub-paragraph would apply when she was floating at her deepest subdivision load line, the Administration may indicate the limiting mean draught at which these sidescuttles will have their sills above the line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side, and having its lowest point 1.37 metres (4½ feet) plus 2½ per cent of the breadth of the ship above the water-line corresponding to the limiting mean draught, and at which it will therefore be permissible to depart from port without previously closing and locking them and to open them at sea on the responsibility of the master during the voyage to the nest port. In tropical zones as defined in the International Convention respecting Load Lines in force, this limiting draught may be increased by 0.305 metres (1 foot).</H6>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(d) Efficient hinged inside deadlights arranged so that they can be easily and effectively closed and secured watertight shall be fitted to all sidescuttles except that abaft one-eighth of the ship's length from the forward perpendicular and above a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point at a height of 3.66 metres (12 feet) plus 2 per cent of the breadth of the ship above the deepest subdivision load line, the deadlights may be portable in passenger accommodation other than that for steerage passengers, unless the deadlights are required by the International Convention respecting Load Lines in force to be permanently attached in their proper positions. Such portable deadlights shall be stowed adjacent to the sidescuttles they serve.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(e) Sidescuttles and their deadlights, which will not be accessible during navigation, shall be closed and secured before the ship leaves port.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(f)</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) No sidescuttles shall be fitted in any spaces which are appropriated exclusively to the carriage of cargo or coal.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) Sidescuttles may, however, be fitted in spaces appropriated alternatively to the carriage of cargo or passengers, but they shall be of such construction as will effectively prevent any person opening them or their deadlights without the consent of the master of the ship.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(iii) If cargo is carried in such spaces, the sidescuttles and their deadlights shall be closed watertight and locked before the cargo is shipped and such closing and locking shall be recorded in such log book as may be prescribed by the Administration.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(g) Automatic ventilating sidescuttles shall not be fitted in the shell plating below the margin line without the special sanction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(h) The number of scuppers, sanitary discharges and other similar openings in the shell plating shall be reduced to the minimum either by making each discharge serve for as many as possible of the sanitary and other pipes, or in any other satisfactory manner.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(i)</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) All inlets and discharges in the shell plating shall be fitted with efficient and accessible arrangements for preventing the accidental admission of water into the ship. Lead or other heat sensitive materials shall not be used for pipes fitted outboard of shell valves in inlets or discharges, or any other application where the deterioration of such pipes in the event of fire would give rise to danger of flooding.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii)</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(1) Except as provided in sub-paragraph (iii) of this paragraph, each separate discharge led through the shell plating from spaces below the margin line shall be provided either with one automatic non-return valve fitted with a positive means of closing it from above the bulkhead deck, or, alternatively, with two automatic non-return valves without such means, the upper of which is so situated above the deepest subdivision load line as to be always accessible for examination under service conditions, and is of a type which is normally closed.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(2) Where a valve with positive means of closing is fitted, the operating position above the bulkhead deck shall always be readily accessible, and means shall be provided for indicating whether the valve is open or closed.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(iii) Main and auxiliary sea inlets and discharges in connexion with machinery shall be fitted with readily accessible cocks or valves between the pipes and shell plating or between the pipes and fabricated boxes attached to the shell plating.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(j)</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) Gangway, cargo and coaling ports fitted below the margin line shall be of sufficient strength. They shall be effectively closed and secured watertight before the ship leaves port, and shall be kept closed during navigation.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) Such ports shall be in no case fitted so as to have their lowest point below the deepest subdivision load line.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(k)</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) The inboard opening of each ash-shoot, rubbish-shoot, etc. shall be fitted with an efficient cover.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) If the inboard opening is situated below the margin line, the cover shall be watertight, and in addition an automatic non-return valve shall be fitted in the shoot in an easily accessible position above the deepest subdivision load line. When the shoot is not in use both the cover and the valve shall be kept closed and secured.</H5></BODY></HTML>
