<H3 class=regulation>Life-Saving Signals</H3>
<H5 class=body1>The following signals shall be used by life-saving stations and maritime rescue units when communicating with ships or persons in distress and by ships or persons in distress when communicating with life-saving stations and maritime rescue units. The signals used by aircraft engaged in search and rescue operations to direct ships are indicated in paragraph (d) below. An illustrated table describing the signals listed below shall be readily available to the officer of the watch of every ship to which this Chapter applies.</H5>

<H4 class=subtitle>(d) Signals used by aircraft engaged on search and rescue operations to direct ships towards an aircraft, ship or person in distress(see explanatory Note below):</H4>
<H5 class=body1>Note: Advance notification of changes in these signals will be given by the Organization as necessary.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>(i) The following procedures performed in sequence by an aircraft mean that the aircraft wishes to direct a surface craft towards an aircraft or a surface craft in distress:</H5>
<H6 class=body2>(1) circling the surface craft at least once;</H6>
<H6 class=body2>(2) crossing the projected course of the surface craft close ahead at low altitude, opening and closing the throttle or changing the propeller pitch;</H6>
<H6 class=body2>(3) heading in the direction in which the surface craft is to be directed. Repetition of such procedures has the same meaning.</H6>
<H5 class=body1>(ii) The following procedure performed by an aircraft means that the assistance of the surface craft to which the signal is directed is no longer required: - crossing the wake of the surface craft close astern at a low altitude, opening and closing the throttle or changing the propeller pitch.</H5></BODY></HTML>
