<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">3.1 In case any one main vertical zone is unserviceable due to fire, the following systems shall be so arranged and segregated as to remain operational:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 fire main;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 internal communications (in support of fire-fighting as required for passenger and crew notification and evacuation);</H6>

<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.6 guidance systems for evacuation shall be available.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">3.2 The above systems shall be capable of operation for at least 3 h based on the assumption of no damage outside the unserviceable main vertical zone. These systems are not required to remain operational within the unserviceable main vertical zones.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">3.3 Cabling and piping within a trunk constructed to an “A-60” standard shall be deemed to remain intact and serviceable while passing through the unserviceable main vertical zone for the purposes of paragraph 3.1. An equivalent degree of protection for cabling and piping may be approved by the Administration.</H5>
