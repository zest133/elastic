<H6 class=footnote style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">* Refer to the Code on Alerts and Indicators as adopted by the Organization by <A href="UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=51056&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=false">resolution A.1021(26)</A>,&nbsp;as may be amended.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">9.1 Passenger ships shall at all times when at sea, or in port (except when out of service), be so manned or equipped as to ensure that any initial fire alarm is immediately received by a responsible member of the crew. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">9.2 The control panel of fixed fire detection and fire alarm systems shall be designed on the fail-safe principle (e.g. an open detector circuit shall cause an alarm condition). </H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">9.3 Passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers shall have the fire detection alarms for the systems required by paragraph 5.2 centralized in a continuously manned central control station. In addition, controls for remote closing of the fire doors and shutting down the ventilation fans shall be centralized in the same location. The ventilation fans shall be capable of reactivation by the crew at the continuously manned control station. The control panels in the central control station shall be capable of indicating open or closed positions of fire doors and closed or off status of the detectors, alarms and fans. The control panel shall be continuously powered and shall have an automatic change-over to standby power supply in case of loss of normal power supply. The control panel shall be powered from the main source of electrical power and the emergency source of electrical power defined by regulation II-1/42 unless other arrangements are permitted by the regulations, as applicable.&nbsp;<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=252&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 148</A></H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">9.4 A special alarm, operated from the navigation bridge or fire control station, shall be fitted to summon the crew. This alarm may be part of the ship's general alarm system and shall be capable of being sounded independently of the alarm to the passenger spaces. </H5></BODY></HTML>
