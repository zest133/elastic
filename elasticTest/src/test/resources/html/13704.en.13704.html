<H3 class=regulation align=center>Passenger ships carrying goods vehicles and accompanying personnel</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 This Reg. applies to passenger ships regardless of the date of construction designed or adapted for the carriage of goods vehicles and accompanying personnel where the total number of persons on board, other than those specified in Reg. I/2(e)(i) and(ii), exceeds 12.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 If in such a ship the total number of passengers which include personnel accompanying vehicles does not exceed N = 12 + A/25, where A = total deck area (square metres) of spaces available for the stowage of goods vehicles and where the clear height at the stowage position and at the entrance to such spaces is not less than 4 m, the provisions of Reg. 15.10 in respect of watertight doors apply except that the doors may be fitted at any level in watertight bulkheads dividing cargo spaces. Additionally, indicators are required on the navigating bridge to show automatically when each door is closed and all door fastenings are secured.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 When applying the provisions of this Chapter to such a ship, N shall be taken as the maximum number of passengers for which the ship may be certified in accordance with this Regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 In applying Reg. 8 for the worst operating conditions, the permeability for cargo spaces intended for the stowage of goods vehicles and containers shall be derived by calculation in which the goods vehicles and containers shall be assumed to be non-watertight and their permeability taken as 65. For ships engaged in dedicated services the actual value of permeability for goods vehicles or containers may be applied. In no case shall the permeability of the cargo spaces in which the goods vehicles and containers are carried be taken as less than 60.</H4>
