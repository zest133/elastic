<H3 class=regulation align=center>Radio installations</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Every ship shall be provided with radio installations capable of complying with the functional requirements prescribed by regulation 4 throughout its intended voyage and, unless exempted under regulation 3, complying with the requirements of regulation 7 and, as appropriate for the sea area or areas through which it will pass during its intended voyage, the requirements of either regulation 8, 9, 10 or 11.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Every radio installation shall :</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 be so located that no harmful interference of mechanical, electrical or other origin affects its proper use, and so as to ensure electro-magnetic compatibility and avoidance of harmful interaction with other equipment and systems ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 be so located as to ensure the greatest possible degree of safety and operational availability ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 be protected against harmful effects of water, extremes of temperature and other adverse environmental conditions ;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 be provided with reliable, permanently arranged electrical lighting, independent of the main and emergency sources of electrical power, for the adequate illumination of the radio controls for operating the radio installation ; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 be clearly marked with the call sign, the ship station identity and other codes as applicable for the use of the radio installation.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Control of the VHF radiotelephone channels, required for navigational safety, shall be immediately available on the navigating bridge convenient to the conning position and, where necessary, facilities should be available to permit radiocommunications from the wings of the navigating bridge. Portable VHF equipment may be used to meet the latter provision.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 In passenger ships, a distress panel shall be installed at the conning position. This panel shall contain either one single button which, when pressed, initiates a distress alert using all radiocommunication installations required on board for that purpose or one button for each individual installation. The panel shall clearly and visually indicate whenever any button or button or buttons have been pressed. Means shall be provided to prevent inadvertant activation of the button or buttons. If the satellite EPIRB is used as the secondary means of distress alerting and is not remotely activated, it shall be acceptable to have an additional EPIRB installed in the wheelhouse near the conning position.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 In passenger ships, information on the ship's position shall be continuously and automatically provided to all relevant radiocommunication equipment to be included in the initial distress alert when the button or buttons on the distress panel is pressed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 In passenger ships, a distress alarm panel shall be installed at the conning position. The distress alarm panel shall provide visual and audible indication of any distress alert or alerts received on board and shall also indicate through which radiocommunication service the distress alerts have been received.</H4>
