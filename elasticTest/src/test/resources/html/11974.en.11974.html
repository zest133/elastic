<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 17</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Openings in the shell plating of passenger ships below the margin line</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The number of openings in the shell plating shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The arrangement and efficiency of the means for closing any opening in the shell plating shall be consistent with its intended purpose and the position in which it is fitted and generally to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.1 Subject to the requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines in force, no sidescuttle shall be fitted in such a position that its sill is below a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point 2.5 percent of the breadth of the ship above the deepest subdivision load line, or 500 mm, whichever is the greater.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.2 All sidescuttles the sills of which are below the margin line, as permitted by paragraph 3.1 shall be of such construction as will effectively prevent any person opening them without the consent of the master of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.3.1 Where in a between decks, the sills of any of the sidescuttles referred to in paragraph 3.2 are below a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point 1.4 m plus 2.5 percent of the breadth of the ship above the water when the ship departs from any port, all the sidescuttles in that between decks shall be closed watertight and locked before the ship leaves port, and they shall not be opened before the ship arrives at the next port. In the application of this paragraph the appropriate allowance for fresh water may be made when applicable.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.3.2 The time of opening such sidescuttles in port and of closing and locking them before the ship leaves port shall be entered in such log book as may be prescribed by the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.3.3 For any ship that has one or more sidescuttles so placed that the requirements of paragraph 3.3.1 would apply when it was floating at its deepest subdivision load line, the Administration may indicate the limiting mean draught at which these sidescuttles will have their sills above the line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side, and having its lowest point 1.4 m plus 2.5 percent of the breadth of the ship above the water-line corresponding to the limiting mean draught,and at which it will therefore be permissible to depart from port without previously closing and locking them and to open them at sea on the responsibility of the master during the voyage to the next port. In tropical zones as defined in the International Convention on Load Lines in force, this limiting draught may be increased by 0.3 m.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Efficient hinged inside deadlights so arranged that they can be easily and effectively closed and secured watertight, shall be fitted to all sidescuttles except that abaft one-eighth of the ship's length from the forward perpendicular and above a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point at a height of 3.7 m plus 2.5 percent of the breadth of the ship above the deepest subdivision load line, the deadlights may be portable in passenger accommodation other than that for steerage passengers, unless the deadlights are required by the International Convention on Load Lines in force to be permanently attached in their proper positions. Such portable deadlights shall be stowed adjacent to the sidescuttles they serve.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Sidescuttles and their deadlights which will not be accessible during navigation shall be closed and secured before the ship leaves port.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.1 No sidescuttles shall be fitted in any spaces which are appropriated exclusively to the carriage of cargo or coal.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.2 Sidescuttles may, however, be fitted in spaces appropriated alternatively to the carriage of cargo or passengers, but they shall be of such construction as will effectively prevent any person opening them or their deadlights without the consent of the master.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6.3 If cargo is carried in such spaces, the sidescuttles and their deadlights shall be closed watertight and locked before the cargo is shipped and such closing and locking shall be recorded in such log book as may be prescribed by the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Automatic ventilating sidescuttles shall not be fitted in the shell plating below the margin line without the special sanction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 The number of scuppers, sanitary discharges and other similar openings in the shell plating shall be reduced to the minimum either by making each discharge serve for as many as possible of the sanitary and other pipes, or in any other satisfactory manner.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.1 All inlets and discharges in the shell plating shall be fitted with efficient and accessible arrangements for preventing the accidental admission of water into the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.2.1 Subject to the requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines in force, and except as provided in paragraph 9.3, each separate discharge led through the shell plating from spaces below the margin line shall be provided with either one automatic non-return valve fitted with a positive means of closing it from above the bulkhead deck or with two automatic non-return valves without positive means of closing, provided that the inboard valve is situated above the deepest subdivision load line and is always accessible for examination under service conditions. Where a valve with positive means of closing is fitted, the operating position above the bulkhead deck shall always be readily accessible and means shall be provided for indicating whether the valve is open or closed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.2.2 The requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines in force shall apply to discharges led through the shell plating from spaces above the margin line.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.3 Machinery space main and auxiliary sea inlets and discharges in connexion with the operation of machinery shall be fitted with readily accessible valves between the pipes and the shell plating or between the pipes and fabricated boxes attached to the shell plating. The valves may be controlled locally and shall be provided with indicators showing whether they are open or closed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.4 All shell fittings and valves required by this Regulation shall be of steel, bronze or other approved ductile material. Valves of ordinary cast iron or similar material are not acceptable. All pipes to which this Reg. refers shall be of steel or other equivalent material to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.1 Gangway, cargo and coaling ports fitted below the margin line shall be of sufficient strength. They shall be effectively closed and secured watertight before the ship leaves port, and shall be kept closed during navigation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10.2 Such ports shall in no case be so fitted as to have their lowest point below the deepest subdivision load line.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11.1 The inboard opening of each ash-shoot, rubbish-shoot, etc. shall be fitted with an efficient cover.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11.2 If the inboard opening is situated below the margin line, the cover shall be watertight, and in addition an automatic non-return valve shall be fitted in the shoot in an easily accessible position above the deepest subdivision load line. When the shoot is not in use both the cover and the valve shall be kept closed and secured.</H4></BODY></HTML>
