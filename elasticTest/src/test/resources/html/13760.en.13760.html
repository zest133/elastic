<H3 class=regulation>Stability information</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle>1 The master of the ship shall be supplied with such reliable information as is necessary to enable him by rapid and simple means to obtain accurate guidance as to the stability of the ship under varying conditions of service. The information shall include: <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=265&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 161</A></H4>
<H5 class=body1>.1 a curve of minimum operational metacentric height (GM) versus draught which assures compliance with the relevant intact stability requirements and the requirements of regulations 25-1 to 25-6, alternatively a corresponding curve of the maximum allowable vertical centre of gravity (KG) versus draught, or with the equivalents of either of these curves;</H5>
<H5 class=body1>.2 instructions concerning the operation of cross flooding arrangements; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1>.3 all other data and aids which might be necessary to maintain stability after damage.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>2 There shall be permanently exhibited, or readily available on the navigating bridge, for the guidance of the officer in charge of the ship, plans showing clearly for each deck and hold the boundaries of the watertight compartments, the openings therein with the means of closure and position of any controls thereof, and the arrangements for the correction of any list due to flooding. In addition, booklets containing the aforementioned information shall he made available to the officers of the ship. *</H4>

<H4 class=subtitle>3 In order to provide the information referred to in 1.1, the limiting GM (or KG) values to be used, if they have been determined from considerations related to the subdivision index, the limiting GM shall be varied linearly between the deepest subdivision load line and the partial load line**. In such cases, for draughts below the partial load line if the minimum GM requirement at this draught results from the calculation of the subdivision index, then this GM value shall be assumed for lesser draughts, unless the intact stability requirements apply.</H4>
