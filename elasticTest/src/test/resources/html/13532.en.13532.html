<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(This regulation applies to all passenger ships with ro-ro cargo spaces or special category spaces as defined in regulation II-2/3, except that for ships constructed before 22 October 1989, paragraph 2 shall apply not later than 22 October 1992)</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Indicators shall be provided on the navigating bridge for all shell doors, loading doors and other closing appliances which, if left open or not properly secured could, in the opinion of the Administration, lead to major flooding of a special category space or ro-ro cargo space. The indicator system* shall be designed on the fail safe principle and shall show if the door is not fully closed or not secured. The power supply for the indicator system shall be independent of the power supply for operating and securing the doors.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to resolution MSC.11(55), by which the Maritime Safety Committee resolved that ships constructed before 22 October 1989 which are already fitted with indicators approved by the Administration which may be different from those required by this regulation should not be required to change their systems.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Means shall be arranged, such as television surveillance or a water leakage detection system, to provide an indication to the navigating bridge of any leakage through bow doors, stern doors or any other cargo or vehicle loading doors which could lead to major flooding of special category spaces or ro-ro cargo spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Special category spaces and ro-ro cargo spaces shall either be patrolled or monitored by effective means, such as television surveillance, so that movement of vehicles in adverse weather and unauthorized access by passengers can be observed whilst the ship is underway.</H4>
