<H3 class=regulation align=center>Intact Stability Requirements</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The calculations required by this Regulation shall be based upon the stability information provided in accordance with Regulation 19 of Chapter II-1, of the present Convention, or with the requirements of the Administration issuing the document of authorization under Regulation 10 of this Chapter.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The intact stability characteristics of any ship carrying bulk grain shall be shown to meet, throughout the voyage, at least the following criteria after taking into account in the manner described in Part B, the heeling moments due to grain shift:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) the angle of heel due to the shift of grain shall be not greater than 12 degrees except that an Administration giving authorization in accordance with Regulation10 of this Chapter may require a lesser angle of heel if it considers that experience shows this to be necessary;*</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* For example, the permissible angle of heel might be limited to the angle of heel at which the edge of the weather deck would be immersed in still water.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) in the statical stability diagram, the net or residual area between the heeling arm curve and the righting arm curve up to the angle of heel of maximum difference between the ordinates of the two curves, or 40 degrees or the "angle of flooding" ( f ), whichever is the least, shall in all conditions of loading be not less than 0.075 metre-radians; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) the initial metacentric height, after correction for the free surface effects of liquids in tanks, shall be not less than 0.30 metre.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Before loading bulk grain the master shall, if so required by the Contracting Government of the country of the port of loading, demonstrate the ability of the ship at all stages of any voyage to comply with the stability criteria required by paragraph</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) of this Regulation using the information approved and issued under Regulations 10 and 11 of this Chapter.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) After loading, the master shall ensure that the ship shall be upright before proceeding to sea.</H4></BODY></HTML>
