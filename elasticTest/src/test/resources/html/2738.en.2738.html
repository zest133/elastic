<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Damage stability requirements applicable to bulk carriers</H3>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=footnote><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">&nbsp;Refer to the <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=49145&amp;localekey=en">IACS UI SC226</A>&nbsp;IACS Unified Interpretations (UI) for the application of SOLAS regulations to conversions of Single Hull Tanker to Double Hull Tanker or Bulk Carrier/Ore Carrier</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1 Bulk carriers of 150 m in length and upwards of single-side skin construction, designed to carry solid bulk cargoes having a density of 1,000 kg/m3 and above, constructed on or after 1 July 1999 shall, when loaded to the summer load line, be able to withstand flooding of any one cargo hold in all loading conditions and remain afloat in a satisfactory condition of equilibrium, as specified in paragraph 4.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2 Bulk carriers of 150 m in length and upwards of double-side skin construction in which any part of longitudinal bulkhead is located within B/5 or 11.5 m, whichever is less, inboard from the ship's side at right angle to the centreline at the assigned summer load line, designed to carry solid bulk cargoes having a density of 1,000 kg/m3 and above, constructed on or after 1 July 2006 shall, when loaded to the summer load line, be able to withstand flooding of any one cargo hold in all loading conditions and remain afloat in a satisfactory condition of equilibrium, as specified in paragraph 4.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3 Bulk carriers of 150 m in length and upwards of single-side skin construction, carrying solid bulk cargoes having a density of 1,780 kg/m3 and above, constructed before 1 July 1999 shall, when loaded to the summer load line, be able to withstand flooding of the foremost cargo hold in all loading conditions and remain afloat in a satisfactory condition of equilibrium, as specified in paragraph 4. This requirement shall be complied with in accordance with the implementation schedule specified in regulation 3.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4 Subject to the provisions of paragraph 7, the condition of equilibrium after flooding shall satisfy the condition of equilibrium laid down in the annex to resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7006&amp;localekey=en">A.320(IX)</A> - Regulation equivalent to regulation 27 of the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, as amended by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7095&amp;localekey=en">A.514(13)</A>. The assumed flooding need only take into account flooding of the cargo hold space to the water level outside the ship in that flooded condition. The permeability of a loaded hold shall be assumed as 0.9 and the permeability of an empty hold shall be assumed as 0.95, unless a permeability relevant to a particular cargo is assumed for the volume of a flooded hold occupied by cargo and a permeability of 0.95 is assumed for the remaining empty volume of the hold.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>5 Bulk carriers constructed before 1 July 1999, which have been assigned a reduced freeboard in compliance with regulation 27(7) of the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, as adopted on 5 April 1966, may be considered as complying with paragraph 3 of this regulation.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>6 Bulk carriers which have been assigned a reduced freeboard in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (8) of the regulation equivalent to regulation 27 of the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, adopted by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7006&amp;localekey=en">A.320(IX)</A>, as amended by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7095&amp;localekey=en">A.514(13)</A>, may be considered as complying with paragraphs 1 or 2, as appropriate.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>7 On bulk carriers which have been assigned reduced freeboard in compliance with the provisions of regulation 27(8) of Annex B of the Protocol of 1988 relating to the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, the condition of equilibrium after flooding shall satisfy the relevant provisions of that Protocol.</H5>
