<H3 class=regulation align=center>Longitudinal Divisions and Saucers</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) In both "filled compartments" and "partly filled compartments", longitudinal divisions may be provided as a device either to reduce the adverse heeling effect of grain shift or to limit the depth of cargo used for securing the grain surface. Such divisions shall be fitted grain-tight and constructed in accordance with the provisions of Section I of Part C of this Chapter.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) In a "filled compartment", a division, if fitted to reduce the adverse effects of grain shift, shall:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) in a tween deck compartment extend from deck to deck; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) in a hold extend downwards from the underside of the deck or hatch covers as described in Section II of Part B of this Chapter. Except in the case of linseed and other seeds having similar properties, a longitudinal division beneath a hatchway may be replaced by a saucer formed in the manner described in Section I of Part C of this Chapter.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) In a "partly filled compartment", a division, if fitted, shall extend from one-eighth of the maximum breadth of the compartment above the level of the grain surface and to the same distance below the grain surface. When used to limit the depth of overstowing, the height of the centreline division shall be at least 0.6 metre above the level grain surface.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) Furthermore, the adverse heeling effects of grain shift may be reduced by tightly stowing the wings and ends of a compartment with bagged grain or other suitable cargo adequately restrained from shifting.</H4></BODY></HTML>
