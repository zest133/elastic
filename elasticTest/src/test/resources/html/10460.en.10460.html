<H3 class=regulation align=center>Requirements for Rigid Liferafts</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Every rigid liferaft shall be so constructed that if it is dropped into the water from its stowed position neither the liferaft nor its equipment will be damaged.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The deck area of the liferaft shall be situated within that part of the liferaft which affords protection to its occupants. The area of that deck shall be at least 0.3720 square metres (4 square feet) for every person the liferaft is permitted to carry. The nature of the deck shall be such as to prevent so far as practicable the ingress of water and it shall effectively support the occupants out of the water.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The liferaft shall be fitted with a cover or equivalent arrangement of a highly visible colour, which shall be capable of protecting the occupants against injury from exposure whichever way up the liferaft is floating.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The equipment of the liferaft shall be so stowed as to be readily available whichever way up the liferaft is floating.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) The total weight of a liferaft and its equipment carried in passenger ships shall not exceed 180 kilogrammes (400 lbs.). Liferafts carried in cargo ships may exceed 180 kilogrammes (400 lbs.) in weight if they are capable of being launched from both sides of the ship or if there are provided means for putting them into the water mechanically.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) The liferaft must at all times be effective and stable when floating either way up.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) The liferaft shall have at least 96 cubic decimeters (3.4 cubic feet) of air cases or equivalent buoyancy for each person it is permitted to carry which must be placed as near as possible to the sides of the raft.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) The liferaft shall have a painter attached and a lifeline securely becketed round the outside. A lifeline shall also be fitted around the inside of the raft.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(i) The liferaft shall be fitted at each opening with efficient means to enable persons in the water to climb on board.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(j) The liferaft shall be so constructed as not to be affected by oil or oil products.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(k) A buoyant light of the electric battery type shall be attached to the liferaft by a lanyard.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(l) The liferaft shall be fitted with arrangements enabling it to be readily towed.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(m) Liferafts shall be so stowed as to float free in the event of the ship sinking.</H4></BODY></HTML>
