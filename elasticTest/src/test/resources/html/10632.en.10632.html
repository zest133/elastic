<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The Government of the United States of America agrees to continue the management of the ice patrol service and the study and observation of ice conditions, including the dissemination of information received therefrom. The Contracting Governments specially interested in these services undertake to contribute to the expense of maintaining and operating these services; each contribution to be based upon the total gross tonnage of the vessels of each contributing Government passing through the regions of icebergs guarded by the Ice Patrol; in particular, each Contracting Government specially interested undertakes to contribute annually to the expense of maintaining and operating these services a sum determined by the ratio which the total gross tonnage of that Contracting Government's vessels passing during the ice season through the regions of icebergs guarded by the Ice Patrol bears to the combined total gross tonnage of the vessels of all contributing Governments passing during the ice season through the regions of icebergs guarded by the Ice Patrol. Non-contracting Governments specially interested may contribute to the expense of maintaining and operating these services on the same basis. The managing Government will furnish annually to each contributing Government a statement of the total cost of maintaining and operating the Ice Patrol and of the proportionate share of each contributing Government.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Each of the contributing Governments has the right to alter or discontinue its contribution, and other interested Governments may undertake to contribute to the expense. The contributing Government which avails itself of this right will continue responsible for its current contribution up to 1 September following the date of giving notice of intention to alter or discontinue its contribution. To take advantage of the said right it must give notice to the managing Government at least six months before the said 1 September.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) If, at any time, the United States Government should desire to discontinue these services, or if one of the contributing Governments should express a wish to relinquish responsibility for its pecuniary contribution, or to have its contribution altered, or another Contracting Government should desire to undertake to contribute to the expense, the contributing Governments shall settle the question in accordance with their mutual interests.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The contributing Governments shall have the right by common consent to make from time to time such alterations in the provisions of this regulation and of regulation 5 of this Chapter as appear desirable.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) Where this regulation provides that a measure may be taken after agreement among the contributing Governments, proposals made by any Contracting Government for effecting such a measure shall be communicated to the managing Government which shall approach the other contributing Governments with a view to ascertaining whether they accept such proposals, and the results of the enquiries thus made shall be sent to the other contributing Governments and the Contracting Government making the proposals. In particular, the arrangements relating to contributions to the cost of the services shall be reviewed by the contributing Governments at intervals not exceeding three years. The managing Government shall initiate the action necessary to this end.</H4></BODY></HTML>
