<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Machinery</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>1 Where risk from overspeeding of machinery exists, means shall be provided to ensure that the safe speed is not exceeded.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 Where main or auxiliary machinery including pressure vessels or any parts of such machinery are subject to internal pressure and may be subject to dangerous over pressure, means shall be provided where practicable to protect against such excessive pressure.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 All gearing and every shaft and coupling used for transmission of power to machinery essential for the propulsion and safety of the ship or for the safety of persons on board shall be so designed and constructed that they will withstand the maximum working stresses to which they may be subjected in all service conditions, and due consideration shall be given to the type of engines by which they are driven or of which they form part.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4 Internal combustion engines of a cylinder diameter of 200mm or a crankcase volume of 0.6 mÂ³ and above shall be provided with crankcase explosion relief valves of a suitable type with sufficient relief area. The relief valves shall be arranged or provided with means to ensure that discharge from them is so directed as to minimize the possibility of injury to personnel.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>5 Main turbine propulsion machinery and, where applicable, main internal combustion propulsion machinery and auxiliary machinery shall be provided with automatic shut-off arrangements in the case of failures such as lubricating oil supply failure which could lead rapidly to complete breakdown, serious damage or explosion. The Administration may permit provisions for overriding automatic shutoff devices.</H4>
