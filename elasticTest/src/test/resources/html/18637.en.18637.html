<H6 class=body2 align=justify>4.2.1 The fire resistance of doors shall be equivalent to that of the division in which they are fitted, this being determined in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code. Doors and door frames in "A" class divisions shall be constructed of steel. Doors in "B" class divisions shall be non-combustible. Doors fitted in boundary bulkheads of machinery spaces of category A shall be reasonably gastight and self-closing. In ships constructed according to method IC, the Administration may permit the use of combustible materials in doors separating cabins from individual interior sanitary accommodation such as showers. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>4.2.2 Doors required to be self-closing shall not be fitted with hold-back hooks. However, hold-back arrangements fitted with remote release devices of the fail-safe type may be utilized. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>4.2.3 In corridor bulkheads ventilation openings may be permitted in and under the doors of cabins and public spaces. Ventilation openings are also permitted in "B" class doors leading to lavatories, offices, pantries, lockers and store rooms. Except as permitted below, the openings shall be provided only in the lower half of a door. Where such an opening is in or under a door the total net area of any such opening or openings shall not exceed 0.05m². Alternatively, a non-combustible air balance duct routed between the cabin and the corridor, and located below the sanitary unit is permitted where the cross-sectional area of the duct does not exceed 0.05m². Ventilation openings, except those under the door, shall be fitted with a grille made of non-combustible material. </H6>
