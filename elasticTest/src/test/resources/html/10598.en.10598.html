<H3 class=regulation align=center>Direction-Finders</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a)</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The direction-finding apparatus required by regulation 12 of Chapter V shall be efficient and capable of receiving signals with the minimum of receiver noise and of taking bearings from which the true bearing and direction may be determined.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) It shall be capable of receiving signals on the radiotelegraph frequencies assigned by the Radio Regulations for the purposes of distress and direction-finding and for maritime radio beacons.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) In the absence of interference the direction-finding apparatus shall have a sensitivity sufficient to permit accurate bearings being taken on a signal having a field strength as low as 50 microvolts per metre.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) As far as is practicable, the direction-finding apparatus shall be so located that as little interference as possible from mechanical or other noise will be caused to the efficient determination of bearings.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(v) As far as is practicable, he direction-finding antenna system shall be erected in such a manner that the efficient determination of bearings will be hindered as little as possible by the close proximity of other antennae, derricks, wire halyards or other large metal objects.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vi) An efficient two-way means of calling and voice communication shall be provided between the direction-finder and the bridge.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vii) All direction-finders shall be calibrated to the satisfaction of the Administration on first installation. The calibration shall be verified by check bearings or by a further calibration whenever any changes are made in the position of any antennae or of any structures on deck which might affect appreciably the accuracy of the direction-finder. The calibration particulars shall be checked at yearly intervals, or as near thereto as possible. A record shall be kept of the calibrations and of any checks made of their accuracy.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b)</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Radio equipment for homing on the radiotelephone distress frequency shall be capable of taking direction-finding bearings on that frequency without ambiguity of sense within an arc of 30 degrees on either side of the bow.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) When installing and testing the equipment referred to in this paragraph due regard should be given to the relevant recommendation of the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR).</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) All reasonable steps shall be taken to ensure the homing capability required by this paragraph. In cases where due to technical difficulties the homing capability cannot be achieved, Administrations may grant to individual ships exemptions from the requirements of this paragraph.</H5></BODY></HTML>
