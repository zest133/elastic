<H3 class=regulation align=center>Definitions</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>For the purpose of this chapter, unless expressly provided otherwise:</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.1 Subdivision load line is a waterline used in determining the subdivision of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.2 Deepest subdivision load line is the waterline which corresponds to the greatest draught permitted by the subdivision requirements which are applicable.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Length of the ship is the length measured between perpendiculars taken at the extremities of the deepest subdivision load line.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Breadth of the ship is the extreme width from outside of frame to outside of frame at or below the deepest subdivision load line.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Draught is the vertical distance from the moulded base line amidships to the subdivision load line in question.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Bulkhead deck is the uppermost deck up to which the transverse watertight bulkheads are carried.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Margin line is a line drawn at least 76mm below the upper surface of the bulkhead deck at side.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Permeability of a space is the percentage of that space which ca be occupied by water. The volume of a space which extends above the margin line shall be measured only to the height of that line.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 Machinery space is to be taken as extending from the moulded base line to the margin line and between the extreme main transverse watertight bulkheads, bounding the spaces containing the main and auxiliary propulsion machinery, boilers serving the needs of propulsion, and all permanent coal bunkers. In the case of unusual arrangements, the Administration may define the limits of the machinery spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9 Passenger spaces are those spaces which are provided for the accommodation and use of passengers, excluding baggage, store, provision and mail rooms. For the purposes of regulations 5 and 6, spaces provided below the margin line for the accommodation and use of the crew shall be regarded as passenger spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10 In all cases volumes and areas shall be calculated to moulded lines.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>11 Weathertight means that in any sea conditions water will not penetrate into the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>12 An oil tanker is the oil tanker defined in regulation 1 of annex I of the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973.</H4>
