<H3 class=regulation>Regulation 37</H3>
<H3 class=regulation>Openings in "A" Class Divisions</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle>(a) Where "A" Class divisions are pierced for the passage of electric cables, pipes, trunks, ducts, etc., for girders, beams or other structures, arrangements shall be made to ensure that the fire resistance is not impaired.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>(b) Where of necessity, a duct passes through a main vertical zone bulkhead, a fail-safe automatic closing fire damper shall be fitted adjacent to the bulkhead. The damper shall also be capable of being manually closed from both sides of the bulkhead. The operating position shall be readily accessible and be marked in red light-reflecting colour. The duct between the bulkhead and the damper shall be of steel or other equivalent material and, if necessary, to an insulating standard such as to comply with paragraph (a) of this Regulation. The damper shall be fitted on at least one side of the bulkhead with a visible indicator showing if the damper is in the open position.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>(c) Except for hatches between cargo, store, and baggage spaces, and between such spaces and the weather decks, all openings shall be provided with permanently attached means of closing which shall be at least as effective for resisting fires as the divisions in which they are fitted.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>(d) The construction of all doors and door frames in "A" Class divisions, with the means of securing them when closed, shall provide resistance to fire as well as to the passage of smoke and flame as far as practicable equivalent to that of the bulkheads in which the doors are situated. Watertight doors need not be insulated.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>(e) It shall be possible for each door to be opened from either side of the bulkhead by one person only.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>(f) Fire doors In main vertical zone bulkheads and stairway enclosures, other than power-operated watertight doors and those which are normally locked, shall be of the self-closing type capable of closing against an inclination of 3Â½ degrees opposing closure. All such doors, except those that are normally closed, shall be capable of release from a control station, either simultaneously or in groups, and also individually from a position at the door. The release mechanism shall be so designed that the door will automatically close in the event of disruption of the control system; however, approved power-operated watertight doors will be considered acceptable for this purpose. Hold-back hooks, not subject to control station release, will not be permitted. When double swing doors are permitted, they shall have a latch arrangement which is automatically engaged by the operation of the door release system.</H4></BODY></HTML>
