<H3 class=regulation align=center>RECOMMENDATIONS APPLICABLE TO NUCLEAR SHIPS</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>NOTE : Throughout the following Recommendations, "the present Convention" means the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974. Attention is drawn to the Regulations concerning nuclear ships in Chapter Vlll of the present Convention.</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1. General Safety of Nuclear Ships</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(a) Since a casualty involving the non-nuclear features of a nuclear ship, such as a steering gear failure, fire or collision, and so forth, could endanger the nuclear power plant, it is desirable that these features should provide for the maximum practicable safety. A nuclear ship should comply with the relevant requirements of the present Convention, the Administration and a recognized Classification Society. Components and systems such as watertight subdivision, fire protection, bilge pumping arrangements, fire-extinguishing arrangements, electrical installations, steering gear, astern power, stability and navigational aids should receive special consideration to ensure that adequate protection is given to the ship to minimize the hazards peculiar to the nuclear power plant. Consideration should be given to the results of past marine casualties involving similar size ships with the intent of preventing the dangerous uncontrolled release of radioactive or toxic materials In the event of similar casualties.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(b) Special attention should be given to general structural strength of nuclear ships and to the local strength of structures in and around the reactor compartment.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(c) A nuclear ship should remain afloat and have sufficient stability when not less than any two adjacent main watertight compartments are flooded, in all anticipated conditions of loading.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(d) Fire protection systems and the watertight Integrity should be at least equivalent to the highest standards of the present Convention.</H5></BODY></HTML>
