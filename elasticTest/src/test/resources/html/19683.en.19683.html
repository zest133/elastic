<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8.1 The central operating console at the navigating bridge shall have a " master mode" switch with two modes of control : a "local control" mode which shall allow any door to be locally opened and locally closed after use without automatic closure, and a "doors closed" mode which shall automatically close any door that is open. The "doors closed" mode shall permit doors to be opened locally and shall automatically reclose the doors upon release of the local control mechanism. The "master mode" switch shall normally be in the "local control" mode. The "doors closed" mode shall only be used in an emergency or for testing purposes. Special consideration shall be given to the reliability of the "master mode" switch.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8.2 The central operating console at the navigating bridge shall be provided with a diagram showing the location of each door, with visual indicators to show whether each door is open or closed. A red light shall indicate a door is fully open and a green light shall indicate a door is fully closed. When the door is closed remotely the red light shall indicate the intermediate position by flashing. The indicating circuit shall be independent of the control circuit for each door.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8.3 It shall not be possible to remotely open any door from the central operating console.</H4>
