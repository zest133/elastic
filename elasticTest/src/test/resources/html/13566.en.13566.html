<P align=center>Figure 1 </P></H4>
<H5 class=body1>2.3 Each seating position shall be clearly indicated in the lifeboat. </H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>3 Access into lifeboats </H4>
<H5 class=body1>3.1 Every passenger ship lifeboat shall be so arranged that it can be rapidly boarded by its full complement of persons. Rapid disembarkation shall also be possible. </H5>
<H5 class=body1>3.2 Every cargo ship lifeboat shall be so arranged that it can be boarded by its full complement of persons in not more than 3 min from the time the instruction to board is given. Rapid disembarkation shall also be possible. </H5>
<H5 class=body1>3.3 Lifeboats shall have a boarding ladder that can be used on either side of the lifeboat to enable persons in the water to board the lifeboat. The lowest step of the ladder shall be not less than 0.4 m below the lifeboat's light waterline. </H5>
<H5 class=body1>3.4 The lifeboat shall be so arranged that helpless people can be brought on board either from the sea or on stretchers. </H5>
<H5 class=body1>3.5 All surfaces on which persons might walk shall have a non-skid finish. </H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>4 Lifeboat buoyancy </H4>
<H5 class=body1>All lifeboats shall have inherent buoyancy or shall be fitted with inherently buoyant material which shall not be adversely affected by seawater, oil or oil products, sufficient to float the lifeboat with all its equipment on board when flooded and open to the sea. Additional inherently buoyant material, equal to 280N of buoyant force per person shall be provided for the number of persons the lifeboat is permitted to accommodate. Buoyant material, unless in addition to that required above, shall not be installed external to the hull of the lifeboat.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>5 Lifeboat freeboard and stability</H4>
<H5 class=body1>All lifeboats, when loaded with 50per cent of the number of persons the lifeboat is permitted to accommodate seated in their normal positions to one side of the centerline, shall have a freeboard, measured from the waterline to the lowest opening through which the lifeboat may become flooded, of at least 1.5 per cent of the lifeboat's length or 100mm, whichever is the greater.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>6 Lifeboat propulsion</H4>
<H5 class=body1>6.1 Every lifeboat shall be powered by a compression ignition engine. No engine shall be used for any lifeboat if its fuel has a flashpoint of 43°C or less (closed cup test).</H5>
<H5 class=body1>6.2 The engine shall be provided with either a manual starting system, or a power starting system with two independent rechargeable energy sources. Any necessary starting aids shall also be provided. The engine starting systems and starting aids shall start the engine at an ambient temperature of -15°C within 2 min of commencing the start procedure unless, in the opinion of the Administration having regard to the particular voyages in which the ship carrying the lifeboat is constantly engaged, a different temperature is appropriate. The starting systems shall not be impeded by the engine casing, thwarts or other obstructions.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>6.3 The engine shall be capable of operating for not less than 5 min after starting from cold with the lifeboat out of the water.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>6.4 The engine shall be capable of operating when the lifeboat is flooded up to the centerline of the crank shaft.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>6.5 The propeller shafting shall be so arranged that the propeller can be disengaged from the engine. Provision shall be made for ahead and astern propulsion of the lifeboat.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>6.6 The exhaust pipe shall be so arranged as to prevent water from entering the engine in normal operation.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>6.7 All lifeboats shall be designed with due regard to the safety of persons in the water and to the possibility of damage to the propulsion system by floating debris.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>6.8 The speed of a lifeboat when proceeding ahead in calm water, when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment and with all engine-powered auxiliary equipment in operation, shall be at least 6 knots and at least 2 knots when towing a 25-person liferaft loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment or its equivalent. Sufficient fuel, suitable for use throughout the temperature range expected in the area in which the ship operates, shall be provided to run the fully loaded lifeboat at 6 knots for a period of not less than 24 h.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>6.9 The lifeboat engine, transmission and engine accessories shall be enclosed in a fire-retardant casing or other suitable arrangements providing similar protection. Such arrangements shall also protect persons from coming into accidental contact with hot or moving parts and protect the engine from exposure to weather and sea. Adequate means shall be provided to reduce the engine noise. Starter batteries shall be provided with casings which form a watertight enclosure around the bottom and sides of the batteries. The battery casings shall have a tight fitting top which provides for necessary gas venting.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>6.10 The lifeboat engine and accessories shall be designed to limit electromagnetic emissions so that engine operation does not interfere with the operation of radio life-saving appliances used in the lifeboat.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>6.11 Means shall be provided for recharging all engine-starting, radio and searchlight batteries. Radio batteries shall not be used to provide power for engine starting. Means shall be provided for recharging lifeboat batteries from the ship's power supply at a supply voltage not exceeding 55 V which can be disconnected at the lifeboat embarkation station.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>6.12 Water-resistant instructions for starting and operating the engine shall be provided and mounted in a conspicuous place near the engine starting controls.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>7 Lifeboat fittings</H4>
<H5 class=body1>7.1 All lifeboats shall be provided with at least one drain valve fitted near the lowest point in the hull, which shall automatically open to drain water from the hull when the lifeboat is not waterborne and shall automatically close to prevent entry of water when the lifeboat is waterborne. Each drain valve shall be provided with a cap or plug to close the valve, which shall be attached to the lifeboat by a lanyard, a chain, or other suitable means. Drain valves shall be readily accessible from inside the lifeboat and their position shall be clearly indicated.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>7.2 All lifeboats shall be provided with a rudder and tiller. When a wheel or other remote steering mechanism is also provided the tiller shall be capable of controlling the rudder in case of failure of the steering mechanism. The rudder shall be permanently attached to the lifeboat. The tiller shall be permanently installed on, or linked to, the rudder stock; however, if the lifeboat has a remote steering mechanism, the tiller may be removable and securely stowed near the rudder stock. The rudder and tiller shall be so arranged as not to be damaged by operation of the release mechanism or the propeller.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>7.3 Except in the vicinity of the rudder and propeller, a buoyant lifeline shall be becketed around the outside of the lifeboat.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>7.4 Lifeboats which are not self-righting when capsized shall have suitable handholds on the underside of the hull to enable persons to cling to the lifeboat. The handholds shall be fastened to the lifeboat in such a way that, when subjected to an impact sufficient to cause them to break away from the lifeboat, they break away without damaging the lifeboat.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>7.5 All lifeboats shall be fitted with sufficient watertight lockers or compartments to provide for the storage of the small items of equipment, water and provisions required by paragraph 8. Means shall be provided for the storage of collected rainwater.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>7.6 Every lifeboat to be launched by a fall or falls shall be fitted with a release mechanism complying with the following requirements:</H5>
<H6 class=body2>.1 The mechanism shall be so arranged that all hooks are released simultaneously .</H6>
<H6 class=body2>.2 The mechanism shall have two release capabilities as follows:</H6>
<H6 class=body3>.2.1 a normal release capability which will release the lifeboat when it is waterborne or when there is no load on the hooks;</H6>
<H6 class=body3>.2.2 an on-load release capability which will release the lifeboat with a load on the hooks. This release shall be so arranged as to release the lifeboat under any conditions of loading from no-load with the lifeboat waterborne to a load of 1.1 times the total mass of the lifeboat when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment. This release capability shall be adequately protected against accidental or premature use.</H6>
<H6 class=body2>.3 The release control shall be clearly marked in a colour that contrasts with its surroundings.</H6>
<H6 class=body2>.4 The mechanism shall be designed with a factor of safety of 6 based on the ultimate strength of the materials used, assuming the mass of the lifeboat is equally distributed between the falls.</H6>
<H5 class=body1>7.7 Every lifeboat shall be fitted with a release device to enable the forward painter to be released when under tension.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>7.8 Every lifeboat which is fitted with a fixed two-way VHF radiotelephone apparatus with an antenna which is separately mounted shall be provided with arrangements for siting and securing the antenna effectively in its operating position.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>7.9 Lifeboats intended for launching down the side of a ship shall have skates and fenders as necessary to facilitate launching and prevent damage to the lifeboat.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>7.10 A manually controlled lamp visible on a dark night with a clear atmosphere at a distance of at least 2 miles for a period of not less than 12 h shall be fitted to the top of the cover or enclosure. If the light is a flashing light, it shall initially flash at a rate of not less than 50 flashes per minute over the first 2 h of operation of the 12 h operating period.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>7.11 A lamp or source of light shall be fitted inside the lifeboat to provide illumination for not less than 12 h to enable reading of survival and equipment instructions; however, oil lamps shall not be permitted for this purpose.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>7.12 Unless expressly provided otherwise, every lifeboat shall be provided with effective means of bailing or be automatically self-bailing.</H5>
<H5 class=body1>7.13 Every lifeboat shall be so arranged that an adequate view forward, aft and to both sides is provided from the control and steering position for safe launching and manoeuvring.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle>8 Lifeboat equipment</H4>
<H5 class=body1>All items of lifeboat equipment, whether required by this paragraph or elsewhere in this chapter, with the exception of boat-hooks which shall be kept free for fending off purposes, shall be secured within the lifeboat by lashings, storage in lockers or compartments, storage in brackets or similar mounting arrangements or other suitable means. The equipment shall be secured in such a manner as not to interfere with any abandonment procedures.
