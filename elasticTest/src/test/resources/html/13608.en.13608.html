<H3 class=regulation align=center>Sources of energy</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 There shall be available at all times, while the ship is at sea, a supply of electrical energy sufficient to operate the radio installations and to charge any batteries used as part of a reserve source or sources of energy for the radio installations.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 A reserve source or sources of energy shall be provided on every ship, to supply radio installations, for the purpose of conducting distress and safety radio communications, in the event of failure of the ship's main and emergency sources of electrical power. The reserve source or sources of energy shall be capable of simultaneously operating the VHF radio installation required by regulation 7.1.1 and, as appropriate for the sea area or sea areas for which the ship is equipped, either the MF radio installation required by regulation 9.1.1, the MF/HF radio installation required by regulation 10.2.1 or 11.1, or the INMARSAT ship earth station required by regulation 10.1.1 and any of the additional loads mentioned in paragraphs 4, 5 and 8 for a period of at least:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 one hour, on ships constructed on or after 1 February 1995;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 one hour, on ships constructed before 1 February 1995, if the emergency source of electrical power complies fully with all relevant requirements of regulation II-1/42 or 43 including the requirements to supply to the radio installations ; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 six hours, on ships constructed before 1 February 1995, if the emergency source of electrical power is not provided or does not comply fully with all relevant requirements of regulation II-1/42 or 43 including the requirements to supply to the radio installations*</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* For guidance, the following formula is recommended for determining the electrical load to be supplied by the reserve source of energy for each radio installation required for distress conditions: 1/2 of the current consumption necessary for transmission + the current consumption necessary for receiption + current consumption of any additional loads.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 The reserve source or sources of energy shall be independent of the propelling power of the ship and the ship's electrical system.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Where, in addition to the VHF radio installation, two or more of the other radio installations, referred to in paragraph 2, can be connected to the reserve source or sources of energy, they shall be capable of simultaneously supplying, for the period specified, as appropriate, in paragraph 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3, the VHF radio installation and:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 all other radio installations which can be connected to the reserve source or sources of energy at the same time; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 whichever of the other radio installations will consume the most power, if only one of the other radio installations can be connected to the reserve source or sources of energy at the same time as the VHF radio installation.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 The reserve source or sources of energy may be used to supply the electrical lighting required by regulation 6.2.4.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Where a reserve source of energy consists of a rechargeable accumulator battery or batteries:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 a means of automatically charging such batteries shall be provided which shall be capable of recharging them to minimum capacity requirements within 10 hours; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 the capacity of the battery or batteries shall be checked, using an appropriate method *, at intervals not exceeding 12 months, when the ship is not at sea.</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* One method of checking the capacity of an accumulator battery is to fully discharge and recharge the battery, using normal operating current and period (e.g. 10 hours). Assessment of the charge condition can be made at any time, but it should be done without significant discharge of the battery when the ship is at sea.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 The siting and installation of accumulator batteries which provide a reserve energy shall be such as to ensure:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 the highest degree of service;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 a reasonable lifetime;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 reasonable safety;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 that battery temperatures remain within the manufacturer's specifications whether under charge or idle; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 that when fully charged, the batteries will provide at least the minimum required hours of operation under all weather conditions.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 If an uninterrupted input of information from the ship's navigational or other equipment to a radio installation required by this chapter is needed to ensure its proper performance, means shall be provided to ensure the continuous supply of such information in the event of failure of the ship's main or emergency source of electrical power.</H4>
