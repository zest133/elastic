<H3 class=regulation>Regulation 40</H3>
<H3 class=regulation>Fire patrols, detection, alarms and public address systems</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle>1. Manual alarms shall be fitted throughout the accommodation and service spaces to transmit an alarm immediately to the navigating bridge or main fire control station. </H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>2. An approved fire detection or fire alarm system shall be provided which will automatically indicate at one or more suitable points or stations the presence or indication of fire and its location in any cargo space which, in the opinion of the Administration, is not accessible except where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that the ship is engaged on voyages of such short duration that it would be unreasonable to apply this requirement. </H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>3 All ships shall at all times when at sea, or in port (except when out of service), be so manned or equipped as to ensure that any initial fire alarm is immediately received by a responsible member of the crew.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>4 A special alarm, operated from the navigating bridge or fire control station, shall be fitted to summon the crew. This alarm may be part of the ship's general alarm system but it shall be capable of being sounded independently of the alarm to the passenger spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>5 A public address system or other effective means of communication shall be available throughout the accommodation and service spaces and control stations.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>6 For ships carrying more than 36 passengers an efficient patrol system shall be maintained so that an outbreak of fire may be promptly detected. Each member of the fire patrol shall be trained to be familiar with the arrangements of the ship as well as the location and operation of any equipment he may be called upon to use.</H4></BODY></HTML>
