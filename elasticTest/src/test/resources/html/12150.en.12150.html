<H3 class=regulation align=center>Means of escape</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Stairways and ladders shall be arranged to provide ready means of escape to the lifeboat and liferaft embarkation deck from all passenger and crew spaces and from spaces in which the crew is normally employed, other than machinery spaces. In particular, the following provisions shall be complied with:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 Below the bulkhead deck two means of escape, at least one of which shall be independent of watertight doors, shall be provided from each watertight compartment or similarly restricted space or group of spaces. Exceptionally, the Administration may dispense with one of the means of escape, due regard being paid to the nature and location of spaces and to the number of persons who might normally be accommodated or employed there.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 Above the bulkhead deck there shall be at least two means of escape from each main vertical zone or similarly restricted space or group of spaces at least one of which shall give access to a stairway forming a vertical escape.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 If a radiotelegraph station has no direct access to the open deck, two means of escape from or access to such station shall be provided, one of which may be a porthole or window of sufficient size or another means to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 A corridor or part of a corridor from which there is only one route of escape shall not exceed: 13 m in length for ships carrying more than 36 passengers, and 7 m in length for ships carrying not more than 36 passengers.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 At least one of the means of escape required by paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 shall consist of a readily accessible enclosed stairway, which shall provide continuous fire shelter from the level of its origin to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks or the highest level served by the stairway, whichever level is the highest. However, where the Administration has granted dispensation under the provisions of paragraph 1.1 the sole means of escape shall provide safe escape to the satisfaction of the Administration. The width, number and continuity of the stairways shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.6 Protection of access from the stairway enclosures to the lifeboat and liferaft embarkation areas shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.7 Stairways serving only a space and a balcony in that space shall not be considered as forming one of the required means of escape.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.1 In special category spaces the number and disposition of the means of escape both below and above the bulkhead deck shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration and in general the safety of access to the embarkation deck shall be at least equivalent to that provided for under paragraphs 1.1, 1.2, 1.5 and 1.6.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.2 One of the escape routes from the machinery spaces where the crew is normally employed shall avoid direct access to any special category space.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.1 Two means of escape shall be provided from each machinery space. In particular, the following provisions shall be complied with:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 Where the space is below the bulkhead deck the two means of escape shall consist of either:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.1 two sets of steel ladders as widely separated as possible, leading to doors in the upper part of the space similarly separated and from which access is provided to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks. One of these ladders shall provide continuous fire shelter from the lower part of the space to a safe position outside the space; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.2 one steel ladder leading to a door in the upper part of the space from which access is provided to the embarkation deck and additionally, in the lower part of the space and in a position well separated from the ladder referred to, a steel door capable of being operated from each side and which provides access to a safe escape route from the lower part of the space to the embarkation deck.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 Where the space is above the bulkhead deck, the two means of escape shall be as widely separated as possible and the doors leading from such means of escape shall be in a position from which access is provided to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks. Where such means of escape require the use of ladders, these shall be of steel.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3.2 In a ship of less than 1,000 tons gross tonnage, the Administration may dispense with one of the means of escape, due regard being paid to the width and disposition of the upper part of the space; and in a ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and above, the Administration may dispense with one means of escape from any such space so long as either a door or a steel ladder provides a safe escape route to the embarkation deck, due regard being paid to the nature and location of the space and whether persons are normally employed in that space.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 In no case shall lifts be considered as forming one of the required means of escape.</H4></BODY></HTML>
