<H4 class=subtitle>For the purpose of this Chapter, unless expressly provided otherwise:</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>1 "Non-combustible material" is a material which neither burns nor gives off flammable vapours in sufficient quantity for self-ignition when heated to approximately 750°C, this being determined to the satisfaction of the Administration by an established test procedure.* Any other material is a combustible material.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote>* Reference is made to Improved Recommendation on Test Method for Qualifying Marine Construction Materials as Non-Combustible, adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7068&amp;localekey=en">A.472(XII).</A></H6>
<H4 class=subtitle>2 "A standard fire test" is one in which specimens of the relevant bulkheads or decks are exposed in a test furnace to temperatures corresponding approximately to the standard time-temperature curve. The specimen shall have an exposed surface of not less than 4.65 m² and height (or length of deck) of 2.44 m, resembling as closely as possible the intended construction and including where appropriate at least one joint. The standard time-temperature curve is defined by a smooth curve drawn through the following temperature points measured above the initial furnace temperature:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">at the end of the first 5 minutes 556 °C</H5>
