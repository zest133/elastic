<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.1 Application </H5>

<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.2 Basic principles for passenger ships </H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>2.2.1 The basic principle underlying the provisions of this regulation is that the main vertical zoning required by regulation 9.2 may not be practicable in vehicle spaces of passenger ships and, therefore, equivalent protection must be obtained in such spaces on the basis of a horizontal zone concept and by the provision of an efficient fixed fire-extinguishing system. Based on this concept, a horizontal zone for the purpose of this regulation may include special category spaces on more than one deck provided that the total overall clear height for vehicles does not exceed 10 m.&nbsp; <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=262&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 158</A></H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>2.2.2 The basic principle underlying the provisions of paragraph 2.2.1 are also applicable to ro-ro spaces. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>2.2.3 The requirements of ventilation systems, openings in "A" class divisions and penetrations in "A" class divisions for maintaining the integrity of vertical zones in this chapter shall be applied equally to decks and bulkheads forming the boundaries separating horizontal zones from each other and from the remainder of the ship. </H6></BODY></HTML>
