<H6 class=body3 align=justify>Tankers shall be equipped with at least one portable instrument for measuring flammable vapour concentrations, together with a sufficient set of spares. Suitable means shall be provided for the calibration of such instruments. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>5.7.2 Arrangements for gas measurement in double hull and double bottom spaces </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>5.7.2.1 Suitable portable instruments for measuring oxygen and flammable vapour concentrations shall be provided. In selecting these instruments, due attention shall be given to their use in combination with the fixed gas-sampling-line systems referred to in paragraph 5.7.2.2. </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>5.7.2.2 Where the atmosphere in double hull spaces cannot be reliably measured using flexible gas sampling hoses, such spaces shall be fitted with permanent gas sampling lines. The configuration of gas sampling lines shall be adapted to the design of such spaces. </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>5.7.2.3 The materials of construction and the dimensions of gas sampling lines shall be such as to prevent restriction. Where plastic materials are used, they shall be electrically conductive. </H6></BODY></HTML>
