<H3 class=regulation align=center>Distress messages : Obligations and procedures</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The mater of a ship at sea which is in a position to be able to provide assistance, on receiving a signal from any source that persons are in distress at sea, is bound to proceed with all speed to their assistance, if possible informing them or the search and rescue service, that the ship is doing so. If the ship receiving the distress alert is unable or, in the special circumstances of the case, considers it unreasonable or unnecessary to proceed to their assistance, the master must enter in the log-book the reason for failing to proceed to the assistance of the persons in distress and, taking into account the recommendations of the Organization.* inform the appropriate search and rescue service accordingly.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the immediate action to be taken by each ship on receipt of a distress message in the Merchant Ship Search and Rescue Manual(MERSAS), as it may be amended.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The master of a ship in distress or the search and rescue service concerned, after consultation, so far as may be possible, with the masters of ships which answer the distress alert, has the right to requisition one or more of those ships such as the master of the ship in distress or the search and rescue service considers best able to render assistance, and it shall be the duty of the master or masters of the ship or ships so requisitioned to the assistance of persons in distress.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Master of ships shall be released from the obligation imposed by paragraph(a) of this regulation on learning that their ships have not been requisitioned and that one or more other ships have been requisitioned and are complying with the requisition. This decision shall, if possible, be communicated to the other requisitioned ships and to the search and rescue service.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The master of a ship shall be released from the obligation imposed my paragraph (a) of this regulation, and if the ship has been requisitioned, from the obligation imposed by the search and rescue service or by the master of another ship which has reached such persons that assistance is no longer necessary.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) The provisions of this regulation do not prejudice the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Assistance and Salvage at Sea, signed at Brussels on 23 September 1910, particularly the obligation to render assistance imposed by article 11 of that Convention.</H4>
