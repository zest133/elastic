In the system with gas generator the Administration may permit only one blower if that system is capable of delivering the total volume of gas required by paragraph 3 to the protected cargo tanks, provided that sufficient spares for the blower and its prime mover are carried on board to enable any failure of the blower and its prime mover to be rectified by the ship's crew.</H4>
