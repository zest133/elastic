<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>7.3.1 Where a thin plated duct with a free cross-sectional area equal to, or less than, 0.02 m² passes through "A" class bulkheads or decks, the opening shall be lined with a steel sheet sleeve having a thickness of at least 3 mm and a length of at least 200 mm, divided preferably into 100 mm on each side of the bulkhead or, in the case of the deck, wholly laid on the lower side of the decks pierced. Where ventilation ducts with a free cross-sectional area exceeding 0.02 m² pass through "A" class bulkheads or decks, the opening shall be lined with a steel sheet sleeve. However, where such ducts are of steel construction and pass through a deck or bulkhead, the ducts and sleeves shall comply with the following:</H6>

<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.1 The sleeves shall have a thickness of at least 3 mm and a length of at least 900 mm. When passing through bulkheads, this length shall be divided preferably into 450 mm on each side of the bulkhead. These ducts, or sleeves lining such ducts, shall be provided with fire insulation. The insulation shall have at least the same fire integrity as the bulkhead or deck through which the duct passes; and </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.2 Ducts with a free cross-sectional area exceeding 0.075 m² shall be fitted with fire dampers in addition to the requirements of paragraph 7.3.1.1. The fire damper shall operate automatically, but shall also be capable of being closed manually from both sides of the bulkhead or deck. The damper shall be provided with an indicator which shows whether the damper is open or closed. Fire dampers are not required, however, where ducts pass through spaces surrounded by "A" class divisions, without serving those spaces, provided those ducts have the same fire integrity as the divisions which they pierce. Fire dampers shall be easily accessible. Where they are placed behind ceilings or linings, these ceilings or linings shall be provided with an inspection door on which a plate reporting the identification number of the fire damper is provided. The fire damper identification number shall also be placed on any remote controls required.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>7.3.2 Ventilation ducts with a free cross-sectional area exceeding 0.02 m² passing through "B" class bulkheads shall be lined with steel sheet sleeves of 900 mm in length divided preferably into 450 mm on each side of the bulkheads unless the duct is of steel for this length. </H6></BODY></HTML>
