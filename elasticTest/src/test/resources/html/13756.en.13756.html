<H3 class=regulation>Calculation of factor "S<SUB>i</SUB>" </H3>
<H4 class=subtitle>1&nbsp; The factor "S<SUB>i</SUB>". shall be determined for each compartment or group of compartments according to the following: </H4>
<H5 class=body1>1.1 in general for any condition of flooding form any initial loading condition "s" shall be</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2><IMG alt="" src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.90.a01.021.2506/en/picc0.gif" width=185 height=20></H6>
<H6 class=body2>with</H6>
<H6 class=body3>C = 1,&nbsp;if&nbsp;0<SUB>e</SUB>&nbsp; ≤ 25°</H6>
<H6 class=body3>C = 0,&nbsp;if&nbsp;0<SUB>e</SUB> &gt; 30°</H6>
<H6 class=body2><IMG alt="" src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.90.a01.021.2506/en/picc3.gif" width=99 height=35>otherwise </H6>
<H6 class=body2>GZ<SUB>max</SUB> = maximum positive righting lever (in metres) within the range as given below but not more than 0.1 m;</H6>
<H6 class=body2>range&nbsp;=&nbsp;range of positive righting levers beyond the angle of equilibrium (in degrees) but not more than 20 degree; however, the range shall be terminated at the angel where openings not capable of being closed weathertight are immersed;</H6>
<H6 class=body2>?<SUB>e</SUB>&nbsp;= &nbsp;final equilibrium angle of heel (in degrees); </H6>
<H5 class=body1>1.2 S=0 where the final waterline taking into account sinkage, heel and trim, immerses the lower edge of openings through which progressive flooding may take place. Such opening shall include air-pipes, ventilators and openings which are closed by means of weathertight doors or hatch covers, and may exclude those openings closed by means of watertight manhole covers and flush scuttles, small watertight hatch covers which maintain the high integrity of the deck, remotely operated sliding watertight doors, access doors and access hatch covers, of watertight integrity , normally closed at sea and sidescuttles of the non-opening type. However, if the compartments so flooded are taken into account in the calculations the requirements of this regulation shall be applied. </H5>
<H5 class=body1>1.3 For each compartment or group of compartments "S<SUB>i</SUB>" shall be weighted according to draught considerations as follows:</H5>
<H6 class=body2>S<SUB>i</SUB>&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.5&nbsp;S<SUB>1</SUB>+&nbsp;0.5 S<SUB>p</SUB></H6>
<H6 class=body2>where </H6>
<H6 class=body3>"S<SUB>i</SUB>" is the&nbsp; "s"&nbsp; - factor at the deepest subdivision load line </H6>
<H6 class=body3>"S<SUB>p</SUB>" is the&nbsp; "s"&nbsp; - factor at the partial load line </H6>
<H4 class=subtitle>2 For all compartments forward of the collision bulkhead, the "s" - value, calculated assuming the ship to be at its deepest subdivison load line and with assumed unlimited vertical extent of damage is to be equal to 1. </H4>
<H4 class=subtitle>3 Wherever a horizontal subdivision is fitted above the waterline in question the following applies. </H4>
<H5 class=body1>3.1 The "s"value for the lower compartment or group of compartments shall be obtained by multiplying the value as determined in subparagraph 1.1 by the reduction factor "v" according to subparagraph 3.3, which represents the probability that the spaces above the horizontal subdivision will not be flooded. </H5>
<H5 class=body1>3.2 In cases of positive contribution to index "A" due to simultaneous flooding of the spaces above the horizontal subdivision, the resulting "s" value for such a compartment or group of compartments shall be obtained by an increase of the value as determined by subparagraph 3.1 by the "s" value for simultaneous flooding according to subparagraph 1.1, multiplied by the factor (1-v). </H5>
<H5 class=body1>3.3 &nbsp;The probability factor "<IMG alt="" src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.90.a01.021.2506/en/piccc.gif" width=19 height=19>" shall be calculated according to:</H5>

<H6 class=body2>&nbsp;for the assumed flooding up to the horizontal subdivision above the subdivision load line, where "H" is to be restricted to a height of "H<SUB>max</SUB>", </H6>
<H6 class=body2>v<SUB>i</SUB> = 1 , </H6>
<H6 class=body2>&nbsp;if the uppermost horizontal subdivision on way of the assumed damaged region is below "H<SUB>max</SUB>", </H6>
<H6 class=body2>where:</H6>
<H6 class=body3>"H" is the height of the horizontal subdivision above the baseline (in metres) which is assumed to limit the vertical extent of damage, "<IMG alt="" src="/files/treeeditor/e.s.90.a01.021.2506/en/picd1.gif" width=42 height=19>" is the maximum possible vertical extent of damage above the baseline(in metres), or </H6>
