<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.1 For ships carrying more than 36 passengers all bulkheads which are not required to be "A" class divisions shall be at least "B" class or "C" class divisions as prescribed in the tables in regulation 26.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.2 For ships carrying not more than 36 passengers all bulkheads within accommodation and service spaces which are not required to be "A" class divisions shall be at least "B" class or "C" class divisions as prescribed in the tables in regulation 27.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.3 All such divisions may be faced with combustible materials in accordance with the provisions of regulation 34.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 In ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, all corridor bulkheads where not required to be "A" class shall be "B" class divisions which shall extend from deck to deck except:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 when continuous "B" class ceilings or linings are fitted on both sides of the bulkhead, the portion of the bulkhead behind the continuous ceiling or lining shall be of material which, in thickness and composition, is acceptable in the construction of "B" class divisions but which shall be required to meet "B" class integrity standards only in so far as is reasonable and practicable in the opinion of the Administration;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 in the case of a ship protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of regulation 12 the corridor bulkheads of "B" class materials may terminate at a ceiling in the corridor provided such a ceiling is of material which, in thickness and composition, is acceptable in the construction of "B" class divisions. Not withstanding the requirements of regulations 26 and 27 such bulkheads and ceilings shall be required to meet "B" class integrity standards only in so far as is reasonable and practicable in the opinion of the Administration. All doors and frames in such bulkheads shall be of non-combustible materials and shall be so constructed and erected as to provide substantial fire resistance to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 All bulkheads required to be "B" class division, except corridor bulkheads prescribed in paragraph 2, shall extend from deck to deck and to the shell or other boundaries unless the continuous "B" class ceilings or linings fitted on both sides of the bulkheads are at least of the same fire resistance as the bulkhead, in which case the bulkhead may terminate at the continuous ceiling or lining.</H4></BODY></HTML>
