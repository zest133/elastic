<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Protection of Cargo Spaces other than Special Category Spaces intended for the Carriage of Motor Vehicles with Fuel in their Tanks for their own propulsion</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>In any cargo space (other than special category spaces) containing motor vehicles with fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion, the following provisions shall be complied with:</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(a) Fire Detection.</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>There shall be provided an approved fire detection and fire alarm system.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(b) Fire-Extinguishing Arrangements.</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(i) There shall be fitted a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system which shall comply with the provisions of Regulation 8 of this Chapter, except that if a carbon dioxide system is fitted, the quantity of gas available shall be at least sufficient to give a minimum volume of free gas equal to 45 per cent of the gross volume of the largest of such cargo spaces which is capable of being sealed, and the arrangements shall be such as to ensure that the gas is introduced rapidly and effectively into the space. Any other fixed gas fire-extinguishing system or fixed high expansion froth fire-extinguishing system may be fitted provided it gives equivalent protection.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(ii) There shall be provided for use in any such space such number of portable fire extinguishers of an approved type as the Administration may deem sufficient.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(c) Ventilation System.</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(i) In any such cargo space there shall be provided an effective power ventilation system sufficient to give at least 10 air changes per hour. The system for such cargo spaces shall be entirely separated from other ventilation systems and shall be operating at all times when vehicles are in such spaces.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(ii) The ventilation shall be such as to prevent air stratification and the formation of air pockets.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(iii) Means shall be provided to indicate on the navigating bridge any loss or reduction of the required ventilating capacity.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(d) Precautions against Ignition of Inflammable Vapours.</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(i) Electrical equipment and wiring, if fitted, shall be of a type suitable for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures. Other equipment which may constitute a source of ignition of inflammable vapours shall not be permitted.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>(ii) Electrical equipment and wiring, if installed in an exhaust ventilation duct, shall be of a type approved for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures and the outlet from any exhaust duct shall be sited in a safe position, having regard to other possible sources of ignition.</H6></BODY></HTML>
