<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 56</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Location and Separation of Spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Machinery spaces of Category A shall be positioned aft of cargo tanks and slop tanks and shall be isolated from them by a cofferdam, cargo pump room or oil fuel bunker tank; they shall also be situated aft of such cargo pump rooms and cofferdams, but not necessarily aft of the oil fuel bunker tanks. However, the lower portion of the pump room may be recessed into such spaces to accommodate pumps provided the deck head of the recess is in general not more than one-third of the moulded depth above the keel except that in the case of ships of not more than 25,000 metric tons deadweight, where it can be demonstrated that for reasons of access and satisfactory piping arrangements this is impracticable, the Administration may permit a recess in excess of such height, but not exceeding one half of the moulded depth above the keel.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Accommodation spaces, main cargo control stations, control stations and service spaces shall be positioned aft of all cargo tanks, slop tanks, cargo pump rooms and cofferdams which isolate cargo or slop tanks from machinery spaces of Category A. Any common bulkhead separating a cargo pump room, including the pump room entrance, from accommodation and service spaces and control stations shall be constructed to "A-60" Class. Where deemed necessary, accommodation spaces, control stations, machinery spaces other than those of Category A and service spaces may be permitted forward of all cargo tanks, slop tanks, cargo pump rooms and cofferdams subject to an equivalent standard of safety and appropriate availability of fire-extinguishing arrangements being provided to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Where the fitting of a navigation position above the cargo tank area is shown to be necessary it shall be for navigation purposes only and it shall be separated from the cargo tank deck by means of an open space with a height of at least 2 metres. The fire protection of such navigation position shall in addition be as required for control spaces as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Regulation 57 and other provisions as applicable of this Part.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) Means shall be provided to keep deck spills away from the accommodation and service areas. This may be accomplished by provision of a permanent continuous coaming of a suitable height extending from side to side. Special consideration shall be given to the arrangements associated with stern loading.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) Exterior boundaries of superstructures and deckhouses enclosing accommodation and service spaces and including any overhanging decks which support such accommodation, shall be insulated to "A-60" Class for the whole of the portions which face cargo oil tanks and for 3 metres aft of the front boundary. In the case of the sides of these superstructures and deckhouses, such insulation shall be carried as high as is deemed necessary by the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) In boundaries, facing cargo tanks, of superstructures and deckhouses containing accommodation and service spaces the following provisions shall apply:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) No doors shall be permitted in such boundaries, except that doors to those spaces not having access to accommodation and service spaces, such as cargo control stations, provision rooms, and store-rooms may be permitted by the Administration. Where such doors are fitted, the boundaries of the space shall be insulated to "A-60" Class. Bolted plates for removal of machinery may be fitted in such boundaries.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Portlights in such boundaries shall be of a fixed (non-opening) type. Pilot house windows may be non-fixed (opening).</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) Portlights in the first tier on the main deck shall be fitted with inside covers of steel or equivalent material. The requirements of this paragraph, where applicable, except in the case of access to the navigating bridge spaces, shall also be applied to the boundaries of the superstructures and deckhouses for a distance of 5 metres measured longitudinally from the forward end of such structures.</H5></BODY></HTML>
