<H3 class=regulation align=center>General requirements for liferafts</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Construction of liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 Every liferaft shall be so constructed as to be capable of withstanding exposure for 30 days afloat in all sea conditions.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 The liferaft shall be so constructed that when it is dropped into the water from a height of 18m, the liferaft and its equipment will operate satisfactorily. If the liferaft is to be stowed at a height of more than 18 m above the waterline in the lightest seagoing condition, it shall be of a type which has been satisfactorily drop-tested from at least that height.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3 The floating liferaft shall be capable of withstanding repeated jumps on to it from a height of at least 4.5m above its floor both with and without the canopy erected.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.4 The liferaft and its fittings shall be so constructed as to enable it to be towed at a speed of 3 knots in calm water when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment and with one of its sea-anchors streamed.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.5 The liferaft shall have a canopy to protect the occupants from exposure which is automatically set in place when the liferaft is launched and waterborne. The canopy shall comply with the following:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 it shall provide insulation against heat and cold by means of either two layers of material separated by an air gap or other equally efficient means. Means shall be provided to prevent accumulation of water in the air gap;</H6>
