<H4 class=subtitle align=left><U>2 In passenger ships and cargo ships watertight doors shall be tested by water pressure to a head up to the bulkhead deck or freeboard deck respectively. Where testing of individual doors is not carried out because of possible damage to insulation or outfitting items, testing of individual doors may be replaced by a prototype pressure test of each type and size of door with a test pressure corresponding at least to the head required for the intended location. The prototype test shall be carried out before the door is fitted. The installation method and procedure for fitting the door on board shall correspond to that of the prototype test. When fitted on board, each door shall be checked for proper seating between the bulkhead, the frame and the door.
