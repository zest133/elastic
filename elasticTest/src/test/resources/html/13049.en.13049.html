<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 Rescue boats may be either of rigid or inflated construction or a combination of both and shall:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 be not less than 3.8 m and not more than 8.5 m in length;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 be capable of carrying at least five seated persons and a person lying down.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3 Rescue boats which are a combination of rigid and inflated construction shall comply with the appropriate requirements of this regulation to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.4 Unless the rescue boat has adequate sheer, it shall be provided with a bow cover extending for not less than 15% of its length.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.5 Rescue boats shall be capable of manoeuvring at speeds up to 6 knots and maintaining that speed for a period of at least 4 h.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.6 Rescue boats shall have sufficient mobility and manoeuvrability in a seaway to enable persons to be retrieved from the water, marshal liferafts and tow the largest liferaft carried on the ship when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment or its equivalent at a speed of at least 2 knots.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.7 A rescue boat shall be fitted with an inboard engine or outboard motor. If it is fitted with an outboard motor, the rudder and tiller may form part of the engine.

The equipment shall be secured in such a manner as not to interfere with any launching or recovery procedures. All items of rescue boat equipment shall be as small and of as little mass as possible and shall be packed in suitable and compact form.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 The normal equipment of every rescue boat shall consist of:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 sufficient buoyant oars or paddles to make headway in calm seas. Thole pins, crutches or equivalent arrangements shall be provided for each oar. Thole pins or crutches shall be attached to the boat by lanyards or chains;</H6>

<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6 one buoyant line, not less than 50 m in length, of sufficient strength to tow a liferaft as required by paragraph 1.6;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.7 one waterproof electric torch suitable for Morse signalling, together with one spare set of batteries and one spare bulb in a waterproof container;</H6>

<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 An inflated rescue boat shall be constructed in such a way that, when suspended by its bridle or lifting hook:</H5>
