<H2 class=part align=center>PART C- FIRE SAFETY MEASURES FOR CARGO SHIPS</H2>
<H2 class=part align=center>(Regulation 54 of this Part also applies to passenger ships as appropriate)</H2>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 42</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Structure</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4, the hull, superstructure, structural bulkheads, decks and deckhouses shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The insulation of aluminium alloy components of "A" or "B" class divisions, except structure which in the opinion of the Administration is non-load-bearing, shall be such that the temperature of the structural core does not rise more than 200 °C above the ambient temperature at any time during the applicable exposure to the standard fire test.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Special attention shall be given to the insulation of aluminium alloy components of columns, stanchions and other structural members required to support lifeboat and liferaft stowage, launching and embarkation areas, and "A" and "B" class divisions, to ensure:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 that for such members supporting lifeboat and liferaft areas and "A" class divisions, the temperature rise limitation specified in paragraph 2 shall apply at the end of one hour; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 that for such members required to support "B" class divisions, the temperature rise limitation specified in paragraph 2 shall apply at the end of half an hour.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Crowns and casings of machinery spaces of category A shall be of steel construction adequately insulated and openings therein, if any, shall be suitably arranged and protected to prevent the spread of fire.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 One of the following methods of protection shall be adopted in accommodation and service areas:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 Method IC - The construction of all internal divisional bulkheading of non-combustible "B" or "C" class divisions generally without the installation of an automatic sprinkler, fire detection and fire alarm system in the accommodation and service spaces, except as required by Regulation 52.1; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 Method IIC - The fitting of an automatic sprinkler, fire detection and fire alarm system as required by Regulation 52.2 for the detection and extinction of fire in all spaces in which fire might be expected to originate, generally with no restriction on the type of internal divisional bulkheading; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 Method IIIC - The fitting of a fixed fire detection and fire alarm system, as required by Regulation 52.3, in all spaces in which a fire might be expected to originate, generally with no restriction on the type of internal divisional bulkheading, except that in no case must the area of any accommodation space or spaces bounded by an "A" or "B" class division exceed 50 m². Consideration may be given by the Administration to increasing this area for public spaces.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 The requirements for the use of non-combustible materials in construction and insulation of the boundary bulkheads of machinery spaces, control stations, service spaces, etc., and the protection of stairway enclosures and corridors will be common to all three methods outlined in paragraph 5.</H4></BODY></HTML>
