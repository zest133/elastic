<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=footnote><STRONG>*</STRONG> Instead of requirements in this Part, the Regulations on Subdivision and Stability of Passenger Ships as an Equivalent to Part B of Chapter II of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960, adopted by the Organization by Resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=6986&amp;localekey=en">A.265(VIII)</A>, may be used, if applied, in their entirety.</H6>
<H2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=part>(Part B applies to passenger ships only, except that Regulation 19 also applies to cargo ships)</H2>
<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Regulation 3</H3>
<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Floodable Length</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(a) The floodable length at any point of the length of a ship shall be determined by a method of calculation which takes into consideration the form, draught and other characteristics of the ship in question.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(b) In a ship with a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length at a given point is the maximum portion of the length of the ship, having its centre at the point in question, which can be flooded under the definite assumptions set forth in Regulation 4 of this Chapter without the ship being submerged beyond the margin line.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>(c)</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(i) In the case of a ship not having a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length at any point may be determined to an assumed continuous margin line which at no point is less than 76 millimetres (3 inches) below the top of the deck (at side) to which the bulkheads concerned and the shell are carried watertight.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>(ii) Where a portion of an assumed margin line is appreciably below the deck to which bulkheads are carried, the Administration may permit a limited relaxation in the watertightness of those portions of the bulkheads which are above the margin line and immediately under the higher deck.</H5></BODY></HTML>
