<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 11</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Special arrangements in machinery spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The provisions of this Regulation shall apply to machinery spaces of category A and, where the Administration considers it desirable, to other machinery spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.1 The number of skylights, doors, ventilators, openings in funnels to permit exhaust ventilation and other openings to machinery spaces shall be reduced to a minimum consistent with the needs of ventilation and the proper and safe working of the ship.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.2 Skylights shall be of steel and shall not contain glass panels. Suitable arrangements shall be made to permit the release of smoke in the event of fire, from the space to be protected.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.3 In passenger ships, doors other than power-operated watertight doors, shall be so arranged that positive closure is assured in case of fire in the space, by power-operated closing arrangements or by the provision of self-closing doors capable of closing against an inclination of 3.5Â°opposing closure and having a fail-safe hook-back facility, provided with a remotely operated release device.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Windows shall not be fitted in machinery space boundaries. This does not preclude the use of glass in control rooms within the machinery spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Means of control shall be provided for:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 opening and closure of skylights, closure of openings in funnels which normally allow exhaust ventilation, and closure of ventilator dampers;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 permitting the release of smoke;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 closing power-operated doors or actuating release mechanism on doors other than power-operated watertight doors;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 stopping ventilating fans; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 stopping forced and induced draught fans, oil fuel transfer pumps, oil fuel unit pumps and other similar fuel pumps.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 The controls required in paragraph 4 and in Regulation 15.2.5 shall be located outside the space concerned, where they will not be cut off in the event of fire in the space they serve. In passenger ships such controls and the controls for any required fire-extinguishing system shall be situated at one control position or grouped in as few positions as possible to the satisfaction of the Administration. Such positions shall have a safe access from the open deck.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 When access to any machinery space of category A is provided at a low level from an adjacent shaft tunnel, there shall be provided in the shaft tunnel, near the watertight door, a light steel fire-screen door operable from each side.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 For periodically unattended machinery spaces in cargo ships, the Administration shall give special consideration to maintaining fire integrity of the machinery spaces, the location and centralization of the fire-extinguishing system controls, the required shut-down arrangements (e.g. ventilation, fuel pumps, etc.) and may require additional fire-extinguishing appliances and other fire-fighting equipment and breathing apparatus. In passenger ships these requirements shall be at least equivalent to those of machinery spaces normally attended.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 An approved automatic fire detection and alarm system complying with the provisions of Regulation 14 shall be fitted in any machinery space:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 where the installation of automatic and remote control systems and equipment has been approved in lieu of continuous manning of the space; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 where the main propulsion and associated machinery including sources of main electrical supply are provided with various degrees of automatic or remote control and are under continuous manned supervision from a control room.</H5></BODY></HTML>
