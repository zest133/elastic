<H6 class=body3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.3 each step rests firmly against the ship's side; where constructional features, such as rubbing bands, would prevent the implementation of this provision, special arrangements shall, to the satisfaction of the Administration, be made to ensure that persons are able to embark and disembark safely;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.4 the single length of pilot ladder is capable of reaching the water from the point of access to, or egress from, the ship and due allowance is made for all conditions of loading and trim of the ship, and for an adverse list of 15Â°; the securing strong point, shackles and securing ropes shall be at least as strong as the side ropes; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 an accommodation ladder in conjunction with the pilot ladder (i.e. a combination arrangement), or other equally safe and convenient means, whenever the distance from the surface of the water to the point of access to the ship is more than 9 m. The accommodation ladder shall be sited leading aft. When in use, means shall be provided to secure the lower platform of the accommodation ladder to the ship's side, so as to ensure that the lower end of the accommodation ladder and the lower platform are held firmly against the ship's side within the parallel body length of the ship and, as far as is practicable, within the mid-ship half length and clear of all discharges.</H6>
<H6 class=body3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 when a combination arrangement is used for pilot access, means shall be provided to secure the pilot ladder and manropes to the ship's side at a point of nominally 1.5 m above the bottom platform of the accommodation ladder.
