<H3 class=regulation align=center>Application</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Unless expressly provided otherwise, this Part shall apply to tankers carrying crude oil and petroleum products having a flashpoint not exceeding 60°C (closed cup test), as determined by an approved flashpoint apparatus, and a Reid vapour pressure which is below atmospheric pressure and other liquid products having a similar fire hazard.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Where liquid cargoes other than those referred to in paragraph 1 or liquefied gases which introduce additional fire hazards are intended to be carried, additional safety measures shall be required to the satisfaction of the Administration, having due regard to the provisions of the International Bulk Chemical Code, the Bulk Chemical Code, the International Gas Carrier Code and the Gas Carrier Code, as appropriate.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 This paragraph applies to all ships which are combination carriers. Such ships shall not carry solid cargoes unless all cargo tanks are empty of oil and gas freed or unless the arrangements provided in each case are to the satisfaction of the Administration and in accordance with the relevant operational requirements contained in the Guidelines for Inert Gas Systems*.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Reference is made to Revised Guidelines for Inert Gas Systems, adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee at its forty-eighth session in June 1983 <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12478&amp;localekey=en">(MSC/Circ. 353).</A></H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Tankers carrying petroleum products having a flashpoint exceeding 60°C (closed cup test) as determined by an approved flashpoint apparatus shall comply with the provisions of Part C, except that in lieu of the fixed fire-extinguishing system required in Regulation 53 they shall be fitted with a fixed deck foam system which shall comply with the provisions of Regulation 61.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 The requirements for inert gas systems of Regulation 60 need not be applied to all chemical tankers or gas carriers when carrying cargoes described in paragraph 1, provided that alternative arrangements, to be developed by the Organization, are fitted.**</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>** Reference is made to Interim Regulation for Inert Gas Systems on Chemical Tankers Carrying Petroleum Products, adopted by the Organization by resolution A.473(XII).</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Chemical tankers and gas carriers shall comply with the requirements of this Part, except where alternative and supplementary arrangements are provided to the satisfaction of the Administration, having due regard to the provisions of the International Bulk Chemical Code, the Bulk Chemical Code, the International Gas Carrier Code and the Gas Carrier Code, as appropriate.</H4></BODY></HTML>
