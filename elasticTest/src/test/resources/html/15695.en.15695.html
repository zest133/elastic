<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 the Administration has taken into account the effect such exemptions may have upon the general efficiency of the service for the safety of all ships.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 An exemption may be granted under paragraph 1 only:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 if the conditions affecting safety are such as to render the full application of regulations 7 to 11 unreasonable or unnecessary; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 in exceptional circumstances, for a single voyage outside the sea area or sea areas for which the ship is equipped.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Each Administration shall submit to the Organization, as soon as possible after the first of January in each year, a report showing all exemptions granted under paragraphs 1 and 2 during the previous calendar year and giving the reasons for granting such exemptions.</H4>
