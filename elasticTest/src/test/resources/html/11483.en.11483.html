<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9. Safety Assessment</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(a) The Safety Assessment should include sufficiently detailed information to permit qualified personnel to assess the safety of the ship and its power plant, including standards and procedures followed, and to determine whether initial and continued performance will be safe. Typical items which the Safety Assessment should include are a description of the ship; Propulsion and reactor systems; a discussion of the operation under normal sea, port and emergency conditions: a description of reactor control; protection and enclosure; radiation protection; radioactive waste disposal; fuelling; standby and emergency components; test Procedures; manning and training requirements; and an evaluation of credible accidents which indicates that the hazards are minimized. The Safety Assessment should indicate that the reactor installation does not constitute an undue hazard, to the crew, passengers or the public, or to the waterways, or food or water resources.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(b) The content of the Safety Assessment should not be considered limited to the information suggested herein, and such additional specific data as necessary should be made available. The complete Safety Assessment should be prepared for the first installation of a reactor type in a ship type. For second and following generation reactor and ship types where performance and safety have been demonstrated, acceptance may be based on an analysis of deviations from the previous design.</H5>
