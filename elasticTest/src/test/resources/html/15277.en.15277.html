<H3 class=regulation align=center>Ships' routeing</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Ships' routeing systems contribute to safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation, and/or protection of the marine environment. Ships' routeing systems are recommended for use by, and may be made mandatory for, all ships, certain categories of ships or ships carrying certain cargoes, when adopted and implemented in accordance with the guidelines and criteria developed by the Organization.*</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the General Provisions on Ships' Routeing adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7127&amp;localekey=en">A.572(14),</A> as amended. (Link: Resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7497&amp;localekey=en">MSC.71(69)</A> , <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=33283&amp;localekey=en">MSC.165(78) </A>)</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 The Organization is recognized as the only international body for developing guidelines, criteria and regulations on an international level for ships' routeing systems. Contracting Governments shall refer proposals for the adoption of ships' routeing systems to the Organization. The Organization will collate and disseminate to Contracting Governments all relevant information with regard to any adopted ships' routeing systems.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 The initiation of action for establishing a ships' routeing system is the responsibility of the Government or Governments concerned. In developing such systems for adoption by the Organization, the guidelines and criteria developed by the Organization* shall be taken into account.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Ships' routeing systems should be submitted to the Organization for adoption. However, a Government or Governments implementing ships' routeing systems not intended to be submitted to the Organization for adoption or which have not been adopted by the Organization are encouraged to take into account, wherever possible, the guidelines and criteria developed by the Organization.*</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the General Provisions on Ships' Routeing adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="http://krcon.krs.co.kr/contents.aspx?categoryid=7127&amp;localekey=en">A.572(14),</A> as amended.

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Where two or more Governments have a common interest in a particular area, they should formulate joint proposals for the delineation and use of a routeing system therein on the basis of an agreement between them. Upon receipt of such proposal and before proceeding with consideration of it for adoption, the Organization shall ensure details of the proposal are disseminated to the Governments which have a common interest in the area, including countries in the vicinity of the proposed shipsâ€™ routeing system.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Contracting Governments shall adhere to the measures adopted by the Organization concerning ships' routeing. They shall promulgate all information necessary for the safe and effective use of adopted ships' routeing systems. A Government or Governments concerned may monitor traffic in those systems. Contracting Governments shall do everything in their power to secure the appropriate use of ships' routeing systems adopted by the Organization.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 A ship shall use a mandatory ships' routeing system adopted by the Organization as required for its category or cargo carried and in accordance with the relevant provisions in force unless there are compelling reasons not to use a particular ships' routeing system. Any such reason shall be recorded in the ships' log.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 Mandatory ships' routeing systems shall be reviewed by the Contracting Government or Governments concerned in accordance with the guidelines and criteria developed by the Organization. *</H4>
