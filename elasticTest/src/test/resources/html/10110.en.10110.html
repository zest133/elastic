<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fixed Deck Froth System</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>The fixed deck froth system referred to in paragraph (a) of Regulation 60 of this Chapter shall be designed as follows:</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The arrangements for providing froth shall be capable of delivering froth to the entire cargo tank area as well as into any cargo tank, the deck of which has been ruptured.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The system shall be capable of simple and rapid operation. The main control station for the system shall be suitably located outside of the cargo tank area, adjacent to the accommodation spaces and readily accessible and operable in the event of fire in the areas protected.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The rate of supply of froth solution shall be not less than the greater of the following:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) 0.6 litres per minute per square metre of the cargo deck area, where cargo deck area means the maximum breadth of the ship times the total longitudinal extent of the cargo tank spaces, or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) 6 litres per minute per square metre of the horizontal sectional area of the single tank having the largest such area. Sufficient froth concentrate shall be supplied to ensure at least 20 minutes of froth generation when using solution rates stipulated in sub-paragraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph, whichever is the greater. The froth expansion ratio (i.e. the ratio of the volume of froth produced to the volume of the mixture of water and froth-making concentrate supplied) shall not generally exceed 12 to 1. Where systems essentially produce low expansion froth but at an expansion ratio slightly in excess of 12 to 1, the quantity of froth solution available shall be calculated as for 12 to 1 expansion ratio systems. When medium expansion ratio froth (between 50 to 1 and 150 to 1 expansion ratio) is employed the application rate of the froth and the capacity of a monitor installation shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) Froth from the fixed froth system shall be supplied by means of monitors and froth applicators. At least 50 per cent of the required froth rate shall be delivered from each monitor.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e)</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The number and position of monitors shall be such as to comply with paragraph (a) of this Regulation. The capacity of any monitor in litres per minute of froth solution shall be at least three times the deck area in square metres protected by that monitor, such area being entirely forward of the monitor.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) The distance from the monitor to the farthest extremity of the protected area forward of that monitor shall not be more than 75 per cent of the monitor throw in still air conditions.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) A monitor and hose connection for a froth applicator shall be situated both port and starboard at the poop front or accommodation spaces facing the cargo deck. Applicators shall be provided for flexibility of action during fire-fighting operations and to cover areas screened from the monitors.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) Valves shall be provided in both the froth main and the fire main immediately forward of every monitor position to isolate damaged sections of these mains.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) Operation of a deck froth system at its required output shall permit the simultaneous use of the minimum required number of jets of water at the required pressure from the fire main.</H4></BODY></HTML>
