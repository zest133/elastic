Each circuit shall have adequate capacity for supplying all the motors which are normally connected to it and which operate simultaneously. If transfer arrangements are provided in the steering gear room to permit either circuit to supply any motor or combination of motors, the capacity of each circuit shall be adequate for the most severe load condition. The circuits shall be separated throughout their length as widely as is practicable.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Short circuit protection only shall be provided for these circuits and motors.</H5>
