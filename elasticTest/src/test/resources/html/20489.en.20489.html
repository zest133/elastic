<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Cargo tank purging and/or gas-freeing*</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>Arrangements for purging and/or gas-freeing shall be such as to minimize the hazards due to the dispersal of flammable vapours in the atmosphere and to flammable mixtures in a cargo tank. Accordingly:</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12637&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.677 </A>on Revised standards for the design, testing and locating of devices to prevent the passage of flame into cargo tanks in tankers and to the Revised factors to be taken into consideration when designing cargo tank venting and gas-freeing arrangements(MSC/Circ. 450/Rev. 1).</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 When the ship is provided with an inert gas system, the cargo tanks shall first be purged in accordance with the provisions of regulation 62.13 until the concentration of hydrocarbon vapours in the cargo tanks has been reduced to less than 2% by volume. Thereafter, gas-freeing may take place at the cargo tank deck level.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 When the ship is not provided with an inert gas system, the operation shall be such that the flammable vapour is discharged initially:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.1 through the vent outlets as specified in paragraph 1.9;or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.2 through outlets at least 2m above the cargo tank deck level with a vertical efflux velocity of at least 30m/s maintained during the gas-freeing operation;or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2.3 through outlets at least 2m above the cargo tank deck level with a vertical efflux velocity of at least 20m/s and which are protected by suitable devices to prevent the passage of flame.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>When the flammable vapour concentration at the outlet has been reduced to 30% of the lower flammable limit, gas-freeing may thereafter be continued at cargo tank deck level.</H5></BODY></HTML>
