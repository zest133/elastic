<H3 class=regulation align=center>Main source of electrical power and lighting systems</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left><A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=238&amp;localekey=en"><IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 134</A> </H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.1 A main source of electrical power of sufficient capacity to supply all those services mentioned in regulation 40.1.1 shall be provided. This main source of electrical power shall consist of at least two generating sets.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.2 The capacity of these generating sets shall be such that in the event of any one generating set being stopped it will still be possible to supply those services necessary to provide normal operational conditions of propulsion and safety. Minimum comfortable conditions of habitability shall also be ensured which include at least adequate services for cooking, heating, domestic refrigeration, mechanical ventilation, sanitary and fresh water.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.3 The arrangements of the ship's main source of electrical power shall be such that the services referred to in regulation 40.1.1 can be maintained regardless of the speed and direction of rotation of the propulsion machinery or shafting. <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=106&amp;localekey=en"><IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC1</A></H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.4 In addition, the generating sets shall be such as to ensure that with any one generator or its primary source of power out of operation, the remaining generating sets shall be capable of providing the electrical services necessary to start the main propulsion plant from a dead ship condition. The emergency source of electrical power may be used for the purpose of starting from a dead ship condition if its capability either alone or combined with that of any other source of electrical power is sufficient to provide at the same time those services required to be supplied by regulations 42.2.1 to 42.2.3, or 43.2.1 to 43.2.4.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.5 Where transformers constitute an essential part of the electrical supply system required by this paragraph, the system shall be so arranged as to ensure the same continuity of the supply as is stated in this paragraph. <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=187&amp;localekey=en"><IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 83</A></H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.1 A main electric lighting system which shall provide illumination throughout those parts of the ship normally accessible to and used by passengers or crew shall be supplied from the main source of electrical power.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.2 The arrangement of the main electric lighting system shall be such that a fire or other casualty in spaces containing the main source of electrical power, associated transforming equipment, if any, the main switchboard and the main lighting switchboard, will not render the emergency electric lighting system required by regulations 42.2.1 and 42.2.2 or 43.2.1, 43.2.2 and 43.2.3 inoperative.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.3 The arrangement of the emergency electric lighting system shall be such that a fire or other casualty in spaces containing the emergency source of electrical power, associated transforming equipment, if any, the emergency switchboard and the emergency lighting switchboard will not render the main electric lighting system required by this regulation inoperative.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 The main switchboard shall be so placed relative to one main generating station that, as far as is practicable, the integrity of the normal electrical supply may be affected only by a fire or other casualty in one space. An environmental enclosure for the main switchboard, such as may be provided by a machinery control room situated within the main boundaries of the space, is not to be considered as separating the switchboards from the generators.&nbsp;<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=255&amp;localekey=en"><IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 151</A></H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Where the total installed electrical power of the main generating sets is in excess of 3 MW, the main busbars shall be subdivided into at least two parts which shall normally be connected by removable links or other approved means; so far as is practicable, the connection of generating sets and any other duplicated equipment shall be equally divided between the parts. Equivalent arrangements may be permitted to the satisfaction of the Administration. </H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Ships constructed on or after 1 July 1998 : <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=261&amp;localekey=en"><IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 157</A></H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 in addition to paragraphs 1 to 3, shall comply with the following :</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.1 where the main source of electrical power is necessary for propulsion and steering of the ship, the system shall be so arranged that the electrical supply to equipment necessary for propulsion and steering and to ensure safety of the ship will be maintained or immediately restored in the case of loss of any one of the generators in service ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.2 load shedding or other equivalent arrangements shall be provided to protect the generators required by this regulation against sustained overload ;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1.3 where the main source of electrical power is necessary for propulsion of the ship, the main busbar shall be subdivided into at least two parts which shall normally be connected by circuit breakers or other approved means; so far as is practicable, the connection of generating sets and other duplicated equipment shall be equally divided between the parts ;and <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=240&amp;localekey=en"><IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 136</A></H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 need not comply with paragraph 4.</H5></BODY></HTML>
