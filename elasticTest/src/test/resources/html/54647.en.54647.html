<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>3.3.1 The inert gas system for tankers required in accordance with regulation 4.5.5.1 shall be so operated as to render and maintain the atmosphere of the cargo tanks non-flammable, except when such tanks are required to be gas-free.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>3.3.2 Notwithstanding the above, for chemical tankers, the application of inert gas, may take place after the cargo tank has been loaded, but before commencement of unloading and shall continue to be applied until that cargo tank has been purged of all flammable vapours before gas-freeing. Only nitrogen is acceptable as inert gas under this provision.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>3.3.3 Notwithstanding regulation 1.2.2.2, the provisions of this paragraph shall only apply to tankers constructed on or after 1 January 2016. If the oxygen content of the inert gas exceeds 5% by volume, immediate action shall be taken to improve the gas quality. Unless the quality of the gas improves, all operations in those cargo tanks to which inert gas is being supplied shall be suspended so as to avoid air being drawn into the cargo tanks, the gas regulating valve, if fitted, shall be closed and the off-specification gas shall be vented to atmosphere.</U></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify><U>3.3.4 In the event that the inert gas system is unable to meet the requirement in paragraph 16.3.3.1 and it has been assessed that it is impractical to effect a repair, then cargo discharge and cleaning of those cargo tanks requiring inerting shall only be resumed when suitable emergency procedures have been followed, taking into account guidelines developed by the Organization*.</U></H6>
