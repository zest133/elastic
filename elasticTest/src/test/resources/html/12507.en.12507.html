<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Protection of cargo spaces, other than special category spaces, intended for the carriage of motor vehicles with fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>In any cargo space (other than special category spaces)containing motor vehicles with fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion, the following provisions shall be complied with:</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>1 Fire detection</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>There shall be provided an approved automatic fire detection and fire alarm system. The design and arrangements of this system shall be considered in conjunction with the ventilation requirements referred to in paragraph 3.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 Fire-extinguishing arrangements</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.1 There shall be fitted a fixed fire-extinguishing system which shall comply with the provisions of Regulation 5, except that, if a carbon dioxide system is fitted, the quantity of gas available shall be at least sufficient to give a minimum volume of free gas equal to 45 percent of the gross volume of the largest such cargo space which is capable of being sealed, and the arrangements shall be such as to ensure that at least two thirds of the gas required for the relevant space shall be introduced during 10 minutes. Any other fixed gas fire-extinguishing system or fixed high expansion foam fire-extinguishing system may be fitted provided it gives equivalent protection. Furthermore, any cargo space designated only for vehicles which are not carrying any cargo may be fitted with fixed halogenated hydrocarbon fire-extinguishing systems which shall comply with the provisions of Regulation 5.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.2 As an alternative, a system meeting the requirements of Regulation 37.1.3 may be fitted, provided that Reg. 37.2.1 or 37.3.1, as appropriate, is also complied with.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2.3 There shall be provided for use in any such space such number of portable fire extinguishers as the Administration may deem sufficient. At least one portable extinguisher shall be located at each access to such spaces.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 Ventilation system</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3.1 There shall be provided an effective power ventilation system sufficient to give at least 10 air changes per hour for ships carrying more than 36 passengers, and 6 air changes per hour for ships carrying not more than 36 passengers. The system for such cargo spaces shall be entirely separate from other ventilation systems and shall be operating at all times when vehicles are in such spaces. Ventilation ducts serving such cargo spaces capable of being effectively sealed shall be separated for each such space. The system shall be capable of being controlled from a position outside such spaces.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3.2 The ventilation shall be such as to prevent air stratification and the formation of air pockets.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3.3 Means shall be provided to indicate on the navigating bridge any loss or reduction of the required ventilating capacity.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3.4 Arrangements shall be provided to permit a rapid shut-down and effective closure of the ventilation system in case of fire, taking into account the weather and sea conditions.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3.5 Ventilation ducts, including dampers, shall be made of steel and their arrangement shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4 Precautions against ignition of flammable vapours</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4.1 Electrical equipment and wiring, if fitted, shall be of a type suitable for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures. Other equipment which may constitute a source of ignition of flammable vapours shall not be permitted.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4.2 Electrical equipment and wiring, if installed in an exhaust ventilation duct, shall be of a type approved for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures and the outlet from any exhaust duct shall be sited in a safe position, having regard to other possible sources of ignition.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4.3 Scuppers shall not be led to machinery or other spaces where sources of ignition may be present.</H5></BODY></HTML>
