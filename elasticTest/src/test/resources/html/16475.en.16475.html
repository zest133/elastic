<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 give an audible and visual alarm at the navigation bridge when the water level above the inner bottom in the cargo hold reaches a height of not less than 0.3 m, and another when such level reaches not more than 15% of the mean depth of the cargo hold; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 be fitted at the aft end of the hold, or above its lowest part where the inner bottom is not parallel to the designed waterline.
