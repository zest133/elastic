<H3 class=regulation align=center>(D) SAUCERS</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>When a saucer is used to reduce the heeling moments in a "filled compartment", its depth, measured from the bottom of the saucer to the deck line, shall be as follows: For ships with a moulded breadth of up to 9.1 metres, not less than 1.2 metres. For ships with a moulded breadth of 18.3 metres or more, not less than 1.8 metres. For ships with a moulded breadth between 9.1 metres and 18.3 metres, the minimum depth of the saucer shall be calculated by interpolation. The top (mouth) of the saucer shall be formed by the underdeck structure in the way of the hatchway, i.e. hatch side girders or coamings and hatch end beams. The saucer and hatchway above shall be completely filled with bagged grain or other suitable cargo laid down on a separation cloth or its equivalent and stowed tightly against adjacent structures and the portable hatchway beams if the latter are in place.</H4>
