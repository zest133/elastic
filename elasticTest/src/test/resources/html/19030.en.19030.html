<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>2.2.3.2.1 Location of the space </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>The space containing the fire pump shall not be contiguous to the boundaries of machinery spaces of category A or those spaces containing main fire pumps. Where this is not practicable, the common bulkhead between the two spaces shall be insulated to a standard of structural fire protection equivalent to that required for a control station in regulation 9.2.3.3. <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=218&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">IACS UI SC 114</A></H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>2.2.3.2.2 Access to the emergency fire pump </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>No direct access shall be permitted between the machinery space and the space containing the emergency fire pump and its source of power. When this is impracticable, the Administration may accept an arrangement where the access is by means of an airlock with the door of the machinery space being of A-60 class standard, and the other door being at least steel, both reasonably gastight, self-closing and without any hold back arrangements. Alternatively, the access may be through a watertight door capable of being operated from a space remote from the machinery space and the space containing the emergency fire pump and unlikely to be cut off in the event of fire in those spaces. In such cases, a second means of access to the space containing the emergency fire pump and its source of power shall be provided. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>2.2.3.2.3 Ventilation of the emergency fire pump space </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>Ventilation arrangements to the space containing the independent source of power for the emergency fire pump shall be such as to preclude, as far as practicable, the possibility of smoke from a machinery space fire entering or being drawn into that space. </H6></BODY></HTML>
