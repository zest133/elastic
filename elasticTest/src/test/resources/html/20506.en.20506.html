<H3 class=regulation align=center>Inert gas systems*</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(Paragraphs 19.1 and 19.2 of this regulation apply to ships constructed on or after 1 February 1992).</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 The inert gas system referred to in Regulation 60 shall be designed*, constructed and tested to the satisfaction of the Administration. It shall be so designed and operated as to render and maintain the atmosphere of the cargo tanks** non-flammable at all times, except when such tanks are required to be gas free. In the event that the inert gas system is unable to meet the operational requirement set out above and it has been assessed that it is impractical to effect a repair, then cargo discharge, deballasting and necessary tank cleaning shall only be resumed when the "emergency conditions" laid down in the Guidelines on Inert Gas Systems are complied with.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12637&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.677 </A>on revised standards for the design, testing and locating of devices to prevent the passage of flame into cargo tanks in tankers, <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12516&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.485 </A>on Clarification of inert gas system requirements under SOLAS 1974, are amended, and to <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12485&amp;localekey=en">MSC/Circ.387</A>:Revised Guidelines for Inert Gas Systems.</H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>** Throughout this Regulation the term "cargo tank" includes also "slop tanks".</H6></BODY></HTML>
