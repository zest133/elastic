<H3 class=regulation align=center>Stowage of survival craft</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Each survival craft shall be stowed:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 so that neither the survival craft nor its stowage arrangements will interfere with the operation of any other survival craft or rescue boat at any other launching station;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 as near the water surface as is safe and practicable and, in the case of a survival craft other than a liferaft intended for throw-overboard launching, in such a position that the survival craft in the embarkation position is not less than 2 m above the waterline with the ship in the fully loaded condition under unfavourable conditions of trim and listed up to 20Â°either way, or to the angle at which the ship's weatherdeck edge becomes submerged, whichever is less;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 in a state of continuous readiness so that two crew members can carry out preparations for embarkation and launching in less than 5 min;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 fully equipped as required by this chapter;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 as far as practicable, in a secure and sheltered position and protected from damage by fire and explosion.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Lifeboats for lowering down the ship's side shall be stowed as far forward of the propeller as practicable. On cargo ships of 80m in length and upwards but less than 120m in length, each lifeboat shall be so stowed that the after end of the lifeboat is not less than the length of the lifeboat forward of the propeller. On cargo ships of 120m in length and upwards and passenger ships of 80m in length and upwards, each lifeboat shall be so stowed that the after end of the lifeboat is not less than 1.5 times the length of the lifeboat forward of the propeller. Where appropriate, the ship shall be so arranged that lifeboats, in their stowed positions, are protected from damage by heavy seas.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Lifeboats shall be stowed attached to launching appliances.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 In addition to meeting the requirements of regulations 23 and 29, liferafts shall be so stowed as to permit manual release from their securing arrangements.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Davit-launched liferafts shall be stowed within reach of the lifting hooks, unless some means of transfer is provided which is not rendered inoperable within the limits of trim and list prescribed in paragraph 1.2 or by ship motion or power failure.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Liferafts intended for throw-overboard launching shall be so stowed as to be readily transferable for launching on either side of the ship unless liferaft, of the aggregate capacity required by regulation 26.1 to be capable of being launched on either side, are stowed on each side of the ship.</H4></BODY></HTML>
