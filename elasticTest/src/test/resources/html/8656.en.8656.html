<H3 class=regulation align=center>Shipborne Navigational Equipment*</H3>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* See resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=6963&amp;localekey=en">A. 156(ES.IV)</A> : Recommendation on the carriage of electronic positionfixing equipment and resolution A.666(16) : World-wide radionavigation system.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) For the purpose of this regulation "constructed" in respect of a ship means a stage of construction where:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) the keel is laid; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) construction identifiable with a specific ship begins; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) assembly of that ship has commenced comprising at least 50 tonnes or 1 per cent of the estimated mass of all structural material, whichever is less.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b)</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Ships of 150 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall be fitted with:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) a standard magnetic compass, except as provided in sub-paragraph (iv);</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) a steering magnetic compass, unless heading information provided by the standard compass required under (1) is made available and is clearly readable by the helmsman at the main steering position;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(3) adequate means of communication between the standard compass position and the normal navigation control position to the satisfaction of the Administration; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(4) means for taking bearings as nearly as practicable over an arc of the horizon of 360°.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Each magnetic compass referred to in sub-paragraph (i) shall be properly adjusted and its table or curve of residual deviations shall be available at all times.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) A spare magnetic compass, interchangeable with the standard compass, shall be carried, unless the steering compass mentioned in sub-paragraph (i)(2) or a gyro compass is fitted.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) The Administration, if it considers it unreasonable or unnecessary to require a standard magnetic compass, may exempt individual ships or classes of ships from these requirements if the nature of the voyage, the ship's proximity to land or the type of ship does not warrant standard compass, provided that a suitable steering compass is in all cases carried.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Ships of less than 150 tons gross tonnage shall, as far as the Administration considers it reasonable and practicable, be fitted with a steering compass and have means for taking bearings.</H4>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) Ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards, constructed before 1 September 1984 when engaged on international voyages, shall be fitted with a gyro compass complying with the requirements of paragraph (d).</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) On ships provided with emergency steering positions, arrangements shall be made to supply heading information to such position.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) Ships of 500 tons gross tonnage and upwards constructed on or after 1 September 1984 and ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards constructed before 1 September 1984 shall be fitted with a radar installation. From 1 February 1995, the radar installation shall be capable of operating in the 9GHz frequency band. In addition, after 1 February 1995, passenger ships irrespective of size and cargo ships of 300 tons gross tonnage and upwards when engaged on international voyages, shall be fitted with a radar installation capable of operating in the 9GHz frequency band. Passenger ships of less than 500 tons gross tonnage and cargo ships of 300 tons gross tonnage and upwards but less than 500 tons gross tonnage may be exempted from compliance with the requirements of paragraph (r) at the discretion of the Administration, provided that the equipment is fully compatible with the radar transponder for search and rescue.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) Ships of 10,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall be fitted with two radar installations, each capable of being operated independently* of the other. From 1 February 1995, at least one of the radar installations shall be capable of operating in the 9GHz frequency band.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Reference is made to section 4 of the Recommendation on Performance Standards for Radar Equipment, adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7072&amp;localekey=en">A.477(XII)</A></H6>

In ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards constructed on or after 1 September 1984 the plotting facilities shall be at least as effective as a reflection plotter.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(j) </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) An automatic radar plotting aid shall be fitted on :</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(1) ships of 10,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards, constructed on or after 1 September 1984;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(2) tankers constructed before 1 September 1984 as follows:</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>(aa) if of 40,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards by 1 Jaunary 1985;</H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>(bb) if of 10,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards but less than 40,000 tons gross tonnage, by 1 January 1986;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(3) ships constructed before 1 September 1984, that are not tankers, as follows:</H6>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(n) Ships of 100,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards constructed on or after 1 September 1984 shall be fitted with a rate-of-turn indicator.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(o) Except as provided in Regulations I/7(b)(ii), I/8 and I/9, while all reasonable steps shall be taken to maintain the apparatus referred to in paragraphs (d) to (n) in efficient working order, malfunctions of the equipment shall not be considered as making a ship unseaworthy or as a reason for delaying the ship in ports where repair facilities are not readily available.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(p) When engaged on international voyages, ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall be fitted with a radio direction finding apparatus. The Administration may exempt a ship from this requirement if it considers it unreasonable or unnecessary for such apparatus to be carried or if the ship is provided with other radio navigation equipment suitable for use throughout its intended voyages.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(q) Until 1 February 1999, ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards constructed on or after 25 May 1980 and before 1 February 1995, when engaged on international voyages, shall be fitted with radio equipment for homing on the radiotelephone distress frequency.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(r) All equipment fitted in compliance with this regulation shall be of a type approved by the Administration. Equipment installed on board ships on or after 1 September 1984 shall conform to appropriate performance standards not inferior to those adopted by the Organization. Equipment fitted prior to the adoption of related performance standards may be exempted from full compliance with those standards at the discretion of the Administration, having due regard to the recommended criteria which the Organization might adopt in connection with the standards concerned</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(s) A rigidly connected composite unit of a pushing vessel and associated pushed vessel, when designed as a dedicated and integrated tug and barge combination, shall be regarded as a single ship for the purpose of this Regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(t) If the application of the requirements of this Regulation necessitates structural alterations to a ship constructed before 1 September 1984, the Administration may allow extension of the time limit for fitting the required equipment not later than 1 September 1989, taking into account the first scheduled dry-docking of such a ship required by the present Regulations.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(u) Except as provided elsewhere in this Regulation, the Administration may grant to individual ships exemptions of a partial or conditional nature, when any such ship is engaged on a voyage where the maximum distance of the ship from the shore, the length and nature of the voyage, the absence of general navigation hazards, and other conditions affecting safety are such as to render the full application of this regulation unreasonable or unnecessary. When deciding whether or not to grant exemptions to an individual ship, the Administration shall have regard to the effect that an exemption may have upon the safety of all other ships.</H4></BODY></HTML>
