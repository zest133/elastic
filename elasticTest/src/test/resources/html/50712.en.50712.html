<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">2.1 Every crew member with assigned emergency duties shall be familiar with these duties before the voyage begins.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify><U>2.2 On a ship engaged on a voyage where passengers are scheduled to be on board for more than 24 h, musters of newly-embarked passengers shall take place prior to or immediately upon departure. Passengers shall be instructed in the use of the lifejackets and the action to take in an emergency.</U></H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify><U>2.3 Whenever new passengers embark, a passenger safety briefing shall be given immediately before departure, or immediately after departure. The briefing shall include the instructions required by regulations 8.2 and 8.4, and shall be made by means of an announcement, in one or more languages likely to be understood by the passengers. The announcement shall be made on the ship's public address system, or by other equivalent means likely to be heard at least by the passengers who have not yet heard it during the voyage. The briefing may be included in the muster required by paragraph 2.2. Information cards or posters or video programmes displayed on ships video displays may be used to supplement the briefing, but may not be used to replace the announcement. <U>(<IMG src="http://krcon.krs.co.kr/images/icon/link.gif" width=39 height=15>Replaced by </U><A href="http://krcon.krs.co.kr/Admin/TreeEditor/UserCommonTreeRedirect.aspx?CATEGORY_ID=58618&amp;NODE_TYPE=Normal&amp;IS_LEAF=true&amp;IS_VIEWCHILD=true">Res.MSC.350(92)</A><U>)</U></U></H5>

The lifeboat shall then either be free-fall launched with only the required operating crew on board, or lowered into the water by means of the secondary means of launching with or without the operating crew on board. In both cases the lifeboat shall thereafter be manoeuvred in the water by the operating crew. At intervals of not more than six months, the lifeboat shall either be launched by free-fall with only the operating crew on board, or simulated launching shall be carried out in accordance with the guidelines developed by the Organization*. </H6>
