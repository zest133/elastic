<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Regulation 11</H3>
<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Peak and machinery space bulkheads and stern tubes in cargo ships</H3>
<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>(paragraph 8 and 9 of this regulation apply to ships constructed on or after 1 February 1992)</H3>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>1 For the purpose of this Reg. "freeboard deck", "length of ship" and "forward perpendicular" have the meanings as defined in the International Convention on Load Lines in force.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>2 A collision bulkhead shall be fitted which shall be watertight up to the freeboard deck. This bulkhead shall be located at a distance from the forward perpendicular of not less than 5 per cent of the length of the ship or 10 m, whichever is the less, and, except as maybe permitted by the Administration, not more than 8 per cent of the length of the ship.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 Where any part of the ship below the water-line extends forward of the forward perpendicular, e.g. a bulbous bow, the distances stipulated in paragraph 2 shall be measured from a point either:</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.1 at the mid-length of such extension; or</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.2 at a distance 1.5 per cent of the length of the ship forward of the forward perpendicular; or</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>.3 at a distance 3 m forward of the forward perpendicular;</H5>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>whichever gives the smallest measurement.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>4 The bulkhead may have steps or recesses provided they are within the limits prescribed in paragraph 2 or 3. Pipes piercing the collision bulkhead shall be fitted with suitable valves operable from above the freeboard deck and the valve chest shall be secured at the bulkhead inside the fore peak. The valves may be fitted on the after side of the collision bulkhead provided that the valves are readily accessible under all service conditions and the space in which they are located is not a cargo space. All valves shall be of steel, bronze or other approved ductile material. Valves of ordinary cast iron or similar material are not acceptable. No door, manhole, ventilation duct or any other opening shall be fitted in this bulkhead.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>5 Where a long forward superstructure is fitted the collision bulkhead shall be extended weather tight to the deck next above the freeboard deck. The extension need not be fitted directly above the bulkhead below provided it is located within the limits prescribed in paragraph 2 or 3 with the exemption permitted by paragraph 6 and the part of the deck which forms the step is made effectively weather tight.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>6 Where bow doors are fitted and a sloping loading ramp forms part of the extension of the collision bulkhead above the freeboard deck the part of the ramp which is more than 2.3 m above the freeboard deck may extend forward of the limit specified in paragraph 2 or 3. The ramp shall be weather tight over its complete length.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>7 The number of openings in the extension of the collision bulkhead above the freeboard deck shall be restricted to the minimum compatible with the design and normal operation of the ship. All such openings shall be capable of being closed weather tight.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>8 Bulkheads shall be fitted separation the machinery space from cargo and passenger spaces forward and aft made watertight up to the freeboard deck.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>9 Stern tubes shall be enclosed in a watertight space (or spaces) of moderate volume. Other measures to minimize the danger of water penetrating into the ship in case of damage to stern tube arrangements may be taken at the discretion of the Administration.</H4></BODY></HTML>
