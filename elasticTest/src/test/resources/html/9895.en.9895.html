<H3 class=regulation align=center>Stability Information for Passenger Ships and Cargo Ships<STRONG>*</STRONG></H3>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify><STRONG>*</STRONG> Reference is made to the Recommendation on Intact Stability for Passenger and Cargo Ships under 100 metres in length, adopted by the Organization by Resolution A.167 (ES.IV) and Amendments to this Recommendation, adopted by the Organization by Resolution A.206(VII).</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Every passenger ship and cargo ship shall be inclined upon its completion and the elements of its stability determined. The master shall be supplied with such reliable information as is necessary to enable him by rapid and simple processes to obtain accurate guidance as to the stability of the ship under varying conditions of service, and a copy shall be furnished to the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) Where any alterations are made to a ship so as to materially affect the stability information supplied to the master, amended stability information shall be provided. If necessary the ship shall be re-inclined.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The Administration may allow the inclining test of an individual ship to be dispensed with provided basic stability data are available from the inclining test of a sister ship and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that reliable stability information for the exempted ship can be obtained from such basic data.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The Administration may also allow the inclining test of an individual ship or class of ships, especially designed for the carriage of liquids or ore in bulk, to be dispensed with when reference to existing data for similar ships clearly indicates that due to the ship's proportions and arrangements more than sufficient metacentric height will be available in all probable loading conditions.</H4></BODY></HTML>
