<H3 class=regulation style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Radio equipment - Sea areas A1 and A2</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">1 In addition to meeting the requirements of regulation 7, every ship engaged on voyages beyond sea area A1, but remaining within sea area A2, shall be provided with:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 an MF radio installation capable of transmitting and receiving, for distress and safety purposes, on the frequencies:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1.1 2,187.5kHz using DSC; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1.2 2,182kHz using radiotelephony;</H6>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 a radio installation capable of maintaining a continuous DSC watch on the frequency 2,187.5kHz which may be separate from, or combined with, that required by subparagraph .1.1; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.3 means of initiating the transmission of ship-to-shore distress alerts by a radio service other than MF operating either:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.3.1 through the polar orbiting satellite service on 406 MHz; this requirement may be fulfilled by the satellite EPIRB, required by regulation 7.1.6, either by installing the satellite EPIRB close to, or by remote activation from, the position from which the ship is normally navigated; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.3.2 on HF using DSC; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><U>.3.3 through the Inmarsat geostationary satellite service by a ship earth station.</U> (<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=38492&amp;localekey=en"><IMG style="BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">Replaced by Res.MSC.201(81)</A>) </H6>

<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.1 a radio installation operating on working frequencies in the bands between 1,605kHz and 4,000kHz or between 4,000kHz and 27,500kHz. This requirement may be fulfilled by the addition of this capability in the equipment required by paragraph 1.1; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">.2 an INMARSAT ship earth station.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">4 The Administration may exempt ships constructed before 1 February 1997, which are engaged exclusively on voyages within sea area A2, from the requirements of regulations 7.1.1.1 and 7.1.2 provided such ships maintain, when practicable, a continuous listening watch on VHF channel 16. This watch shall be kept at the position from which the ship is normally navigated.</H4></BODY></HTML>
