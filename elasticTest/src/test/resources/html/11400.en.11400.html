<H3 class=regulation align=center>(A) STRAPPING OR LASHING</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) When, in order to eliminate heeling moments in "partly filled compartments", strapping or lashing is utilized, the securing shall be accomplished as follows :</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) The grain shall be trimmed and levelled to the extent that it is very slightly crowned and covered with burlap separation cloths, tarpaulins or the equivalent.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) The separation cloths and/or tarpaulins shall overlap at least 1.8 metres.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iii) Two solid floors of rough 25 mm by 150 mm to 300 mm lumber shall be laid with the top floor running longitudinally and nailed to an athwartships bottom floor. Alternatively, one solid floor of 50 mm lumber, running longitudinally and nailed over the top of a 50 mm bottom bearer not less than 150 mm wide, may be used. The bottom bearers shall extend the full breadth of the compartment and shall be spaced not more than 2.4 metres apart. Arrangements utilizing other materials and deemed by an Administration to be equivalent to the foregoing may be accepted.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(iv) Steel wire rope (19 mm diameter or equivalent), doubled steel strapping (50 mm x 1.3 mm and having a breaking load of at least 5000kg), or chain of equivalent strength, each of which shall be set tight by means of a 32 mm turnbuckle, may be used for lashings. A winch tightener, used in conjunction with a locking arm, may be substituted for the 32 mm turnbuckle when steel strapping is used, provided suitable wrenches are available for setting up as necessary. When steel strapping is used, not less than three crimp seals shall be used for securing the ends. When wire is used, not less than four clips shall be used for forming eyes in the lashings.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(v) Prior to the completion of loading the lashing shall be positively attached to the framing at a point approximately 450 mm below the anticipated final grain surface by means of either a 25 mm shackle or beam clamp of equivalent strength.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vi) The lashings shall be spaced not more than 2.4 metres apart and each shall be supported by a bearer nailed over the top of the fore and aft floor. This bearer shall consist of not less than 25 mm by 150 mm lumber or its equivalent and shall extend the full breadth of the compartment.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(vii) During the voyage the strapping shall be regularly inspected and setup where necessary.</H5></BODY></HTML>
