<H4 class=subtitle align=left>13 The arrangements for inerting, purging or gas freeing of empty tanks as required in paragraph 2 shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration and shall be such that the accumulation of hydrocarbon vapours in pockets formed by the internal structural members in a tank is minimized and that:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 on individual cargo tanks the gas outlet pipe, if fitted, shall be positioned as far as practicable from the inert gas/air inlet and in accordance with Regulation 59.1. The inlet of such outlet pipes may be located either at deck level or at not more than 1m above the bottom of the tank;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 the cross sectional area of such gas outlet pipe referred to in paragraph 13.1 shall be such that an exit velocity of at least 20m/sec can be maintained when any three tanks are being simultaneously supplied with inert gas. Their outlets shall extend not less than 2m above deck level;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 each gas outlet referred to in paragraph 13.2 shall be fitted with suitable blanking arrangements;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4.1 if a connection is fitted between the inert gas supply mains and the cargo piping system, arrangements shall be made to ensure an effective isolation having regard to the large pressure difference which may exist between the systems. This shall consist of two shut-off valves with an arrangement to vent the space between the valves in a safe manner or an arrangement consisting of a spool-piece with associated blanks;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4.2 the valve separating the inert gas supply main from the cargo main and which is on the cargo main side shall be a non-return valve with a positive means of closure.</H5>
