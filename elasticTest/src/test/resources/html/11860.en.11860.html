<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=subtitle>1.1 Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3, all accesses that lead to spaces below the bulkhead deck shall have a lowest point which is not less than 2.5 m above the bulkhead deck.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=subtitle>1.2 Where vehicle ramps are installed to give access to spaces below the bulkhead deck, their openings shall be able to be closed weathertight to prevent ingress of water below, alarmed and indicated to the navigation bridge.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=subtitle>1.3 The Administration may permit the fitting of particular accesses to spaces below the bulkhead deck provided they are necessary for the essential working of the ship, e.g. the movement of machinery and stores, subject to such accesses being made watertight, alarmed and indicated on the navigation bridge.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=subtitle>2 Indicators shall be provided on the navigation bridge for all shell doors, loading doors and other closing appliances which, if left open or not properly secured, could, in the opinion of the Administration, lead to flooding of a special category space or ro-ro space. The indicator system shall be designed on the fail-safe principle and shall show by visual alarms if the door is not fully closed or if any of the securing arrangements are not in place and fully locked and by audible alarms if such door or closing appliances become open or the securing arrangements become unsecured. The indicator panel on the navigation bridge shall be equipped with a mode selection function “harbour/sea voyage” so arranged that an audible alarm is given on the navigation bridge if the ship leaves harbour with the bow doors, inner doors, stern ramp or any other side shell doors not closed or any closing device not in the correct position. The power supply for the indicator system shall be independent of the power supply for operating and securing the doors.</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>3 Television surveillance and a water leakage detection system shall be arranged to provide an indication to the navigation bridge and to the engine control station of any leakage through inner and outer bow doors, stern doors or any other shell doors which could lead to flooding of special category spaces or ro-ro spaces.</H4></BODY></HTML>
