<H3 class=regulation align=center>Safety systems</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>A safety system shall be provided to ensure that serious malfunction in machinery or boiler operations, which present an immediate danger, shall initiate the automatic shut-down of that part of the plant and that an alarm shall be given. Shut-down of the propulsion system shall not be automatically activated except in cases which could lead to serious damage, complete breakdown, or explosion. Where arrangements for overriding the shut-down of the main propelling machinery are fitted, these shall be such as to preclude inadvertent operation. Visual means shall be provided to indicate when the override has been activated.</H4>
