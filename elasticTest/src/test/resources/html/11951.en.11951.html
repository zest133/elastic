<H3 class=regulation align=center>Special requirements concerning passenger ship subdivision</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Where in a portion or portions of a ship the watertight bulkheads are carried to a higher deck than in the remainder of the ship and it is desired to take advantage of this higher extension of the bulkheads in calculating the floodable length, separate margin lines may be used for each such portion of the ship provided that:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 the sides of the ship are extended throughout the ship's length to the deck corresponding to the upper margin line and all openings in the shell plating below this deck throughout the length of the ship are treated as being below a margin line, for the purposes of Regulation 17; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 the two compartments adjacent to the "step" in the bulkhead deck are each within the permissible length corresponding to their respective margin lines, and, in addition, their combined length does not exceed twice the permissible length based on the lower margin line.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.1 A compartment may exceed the permissible length determined by the rules of Regulation 6 provided the combined length of each pair of adjacent compartments to which the compartment in question is common does not exceed either the floodable length or twice the permissible length, whichever is the less.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.2 If one of the two adjacent compartments is situated inside the machinery space, and the second is situated outside the machinery space, and the average permeability of the portion of the ship in which the second is situated differs from that of the machinery space, the combined length of the two compartments shall be adjusted to the mean average permeability of the two portions of the ship in which the compartments are situated.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.3 Where the two adjacent compartments have different factors of subdivision, the combined length of the two compartments shall be determined proportionately. </H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 In ships of 100 m in length and upwards, one of the main transverse bulkheads abaft the fore peak shall be fitted at a distance from the forward perpendicular which is not greater than the permissible length.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 A main transverse bulkhead may be recessed provided that all parts of the recess lie inboard of vertical surfaces on both sides of the ship, situated at a distance from the shell plating equal to one-fifth the breadth of the ship, as defined in Regulation 2, and measured at right angles to the centre line at the level of the deepest subdivision load line. Any part of a recess which lies outside these limits shall be dealt with as a step in accordance with paragraph 5.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 A main transverse bulkhead may be stepped provided that it meets one of the following conditions:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 the combined length of the two compartments, separated by the bulkhead in question, does not exceed either 90 percent of the floodable length or twice the permissible length, except that, in ships having a factor of subdivision greater than .9, the combined length of the two compartments in question shall not exceed the permissible length;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 additional subdivision is provided in way of the step to maintain the same measure of safety as that secured by a plane bulkhead;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 the compartment over which the step extends does not exceed the permissible length corresponding to a margin line taken 76 mm below the step.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Where a main transverse bulkhead is recessed or stepped, an equivalent plane bulkhead shall be used in determining the subdivision.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 If the distance between two adjacent main transverse bulkheads,or their equivalent plane bulkheads, or the distance between the transverse planes passing through the nearest stepped portions of the bulkheads, is less than 3.0 m plus 3 percent of the length of the ship, or 11.0 m whichever is the less, only one of these bulkheads shall be regarded as forming part of the subdivision of the ship in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 6.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 Where a main transverse watertight compartment contains local subdivision and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that, after any assumed side damage extending over a length of 3.0 m plus 3 percent of the length of the ship, or 11.0 m whichever is the less, the whole volume of the main compartment will not be flooded, a proportionate allowance may be made in the permissible length otherwise required for such compartment. In such a case the volume of effective buoyancy assumed on the undamaged side shall not be greater than that assumed on the damaged side.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9 Where the required factor of subdivision is .50 or less, the combined length of any two adjacent compartments shall not exceed the floodable length.</H4></BODY></HTML>
