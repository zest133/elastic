<H3 class=regulation align=center>Automatic sprinkler, fire detection and fire alarm systems</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.1 Any required automatic sprinkler, fire detection and fire alarm system shall be capable of immediate operation at all times and no action by the crew shall be necessary to set it in operation. It shall be of the wet pipe type but small exposed sections may be of the dry pipe type where in the opinion of the Administration this is a necessary precaution. Any parts of the system which may be subjected to freezing temperatures in service shall be suitably protected against freezing. It shall be kept charged at the necessary pressure and shall have provision for a continuous supply of water as required in this Regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1.2 Each section of sprinklers shall include means for giving a visual and audible alarm signal automatically at one or more indicating units whenever any sprinkler comes into operation. Such alarm systems shall be such as to indicate if any fault occurs in the system.</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2.1 In passenger ships such units shall give an indication of any fire and its location in any space served by the system and shall be centralized on the navigating bridge or in the main fire control station, which shall be so manned or equipped as to ensure that any alarm from the system is immediately received by a responsible member of the crew.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2.2 In cargo ships such units shall indicate in which section served by the system fire has occurred and shall be centralized on the navigating bridge and in addition, visible and audible alarms from the unit shall be placed in a position other than on the navigating bridge, so as to ensure that the indication of fire is immediately received by the crew.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.1 Sprinklers shall be grouped into separate sections, each of which shall contain not more than 200 sprinklers. In passenger ships any section of sprinklers shall not serve more than two decks and shall not be situated in more than one main vertical zone. However, the Administration may permit such a section of sprinklers to serve more than two decks or be situated in more than one main vertical zone, if it is satisfied that the protection of the ship against fire will not thereby be reduced.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.2 Each section of sprinklers shall be capable of being isolated by one stop valve only. The stop valve in each section shall be readily accessible and its location shall be clearly and permanently indicated. Means shall be provided to prevent the operation of the stop valves by any unauthorized person.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.3 A gauge indicating the pressure in the system shall be provided at each section stop valve and at a central station.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.4 The sprinklers shall be resistant to corrosion by marine atmosphere. In accommodation and service spaces the sprinklers shall come into operation within the temperature range from 68°C to 79°C, except that in locations such as drying rooms, where high ambient temperatures might be expected, the operating temperature may be increased by not more than 30°C above the maximum deck head temperature.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2.5 A list or plan shall be displayed at each indicating unit showing the spaces covered and the location of the zone in respect of each section. Suitable instructions for testing and maintenance shall be available.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Sprinklers shall be placed in an overhead position and spaced in a suitable pattern to maintain an average application rate of not less than 5ℓ/m²per minute over the nominal area covered by the sprinklers. However, the Administration may permit the use of sprinklers providing such an alternative amount of water suitably distributed as has been shown to the satisfaction of the Administration to be not less effective.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4.1 A pressure tank having a volume equal to at least twice that of the charge of water specified in this sub-paragraph shall be provided. The tank shall contain a standing charge of fresh water, equivalent to the amount of water which would be discharged in one minute by the pump referred to in paragraph 5.2, and the arrangements shall provide for maintaining an air pressure in the tank such as to ensure that where the standing charge of fresh water in the tank has been used the pressure will be not less than the working pressure of the sprinkler, plus the pressure exerted by a head of water measured from the bottom of the tank to the highest sprinkler in the system. Suitable means of replenishing the air under pressure and of replenishing the fresh water charge in the tank shall be provided. A glass gauge shall be provided to indicate the correct level of the water in the tank.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4.2 Means shall be provided to prevent the passage of sea-water in to the tank.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.1 An independent power pump shall be provided solely for the purpose of continuing automatically the discharge of water from the sprinklers. The pump shall be brought into action automatically by the pressure drop in the system before the standing fresh water charge in the pressure tank is completely exhausted.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.2 The pump and the piping system shall be capable of maintaining the necessary pressure at the level of the highest sprinkler to ensure a continuous output of water sufficient for the simultaneous coverage of a minimum area of 280m²at the application rate specified in paragraph 3.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.3 The pump shall have fitted on the delivery side a test valve with a short open-ended discharge pipe. The effective area through the valve and pipe shall be adequate to permit the release of the required pump output while maintaining the pressure in the system specified in paragraph 4.1.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5.4 The sea inlet to the pump shall wherever possible be in the space containing the pump and shall be so arranged that when the ship is afloat it will not be necessary to shut off the supply of sea-water to the pump for any purpose other than the inspection or repair of the pump.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 The sprinkler pump and tank shall be situated in a position reasonably remote from any machinery space of category A and shall not be situated in any space required to be protected by the sprinkler system.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7.1 In passenger ships there shall be not less than two sources of power supply for the sea-water pump and automatic alarm and detection system. Where the sources of power for the pump are electrical, these shall be a main generator and an emergency source of power. One supply for the pump shall be taken from the main switchboard, and one from the emergency switchboard by separate feeders reserved solely for that purpose. The feeders shall be so arranged as to avoid galleys, machinery spaces and other enclosed spaces of high fire risk except in so far as it is necessary to reach the appropriate switchboards, and shall be run to an automatic change-over switch situated near the sprinkler pump. This switch shall permit the supply of power from the main switchboard so long as a supply is available therefrom, and be so designed that upon failure of that supply it will automatically change over to the supply from the emergency switchboard. The switches on the main switchboard and the emergency switchboard shall be clearly labelled and normally kept closed. No other switch shall be permitted in the feeders concerned. One of the sources of power supply for the alarm and detection system shall bean emergency source. Where one of the sources of power for the pump is an internal combustion engine it shall, in addition to complying with the provisions of paragraph 6, be so situated that a fire in any protected space will not affect the air supply to the machinery.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7.2 In cargo ships there shall not be less than two sources of power supply for the sea-water pump and automatic alarm and detection system. If the pump is electrically driven it shall be connected to the main source of electrical power, which shall be capable of being supplied by at least two generators. The feeders shall be so arranged as to avoid galleys, machinery spaces and other enclosed spaces of high fire risk except in so far as it is necessary to reach the appropriate switchboards. One of the sources of power supply for the alarm and detection system shall be an emergency source. Where one of the sources of power for the pump is an internal combustion engine it shall, in addition to complying with the provisions of paragraph 6, be so situated that a fire in any protected space will not affect the air supply to the machinery.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>8 The sprinkler system shall have a connection from the ship's fire main by way of a lockable screw-down non-return valve at the connection which will prevent a back flow from the sprinkler system to the fire main.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.1 A test valve shall be provided for testing the automatic alarm for each section of sprinklers by a discharge of water equivalent to the operation of one sprinkler. The test valve for each section shall be situated near the stop valve for that section.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.2 Means shall be provided for testing the automatic operation of the pump on reduction of pressure in the system.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9.3 Switches shall be provided at one of the indicating positions referred to in paragraph 1.2 which will enable the alarm and the indicators for each section of sprinklers to be tested.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>10 Spare sprinkler heads shall be provided for each section of sprinklers to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4></BODY></HTML>
