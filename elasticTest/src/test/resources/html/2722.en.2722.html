<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=footnote>.3 The application provisions of Annex 1 to the Interpretation of the provisions of SOLAS chapter XII on Additional safety measures for bulk carriers, adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee of the Organization by <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7516&amp;localekey=en">resolution MSC.89(71)</A> .</H6></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>2 Bulk carrier of single-side skin construction means a bulk carrier as defined in paragraph 1, in which:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 any part of a cargo hold is bounded by the side shell; or</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 where one or more cargo holds are bounded by a double-side skin, the width of which is less than 760 mm in bulk carriers constructed before 1 January 2000 and less than 1,000 mm in bulk carriers constructed on or after 1 January 2000 but before 1 July 2006, the distance being measured perpendicular to the side shell.</H6>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>Such ships include combination carriers in which any part of a cargo hold is bounded by the side shell.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>3 Bulk carrier of double-side skin construction means a bulk carrier as defined in paragraph 1, in which all cargo holds are bounded by a double-side skin, other than as defined in paragraph 2.2.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>4 Double-side skin means a configuration where each ship side is constructed by the side shell and a longitudinal bulkhead connecting the double bottom and the deck. Hopper side tanks and top-side tanks may, where fitted, be integral parts of the double side skin configuration.</H5>

<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>6 Solid bulk cargo means any material, other than liquid or gas, consisting of a combination of particles, granules or any larger pieces of material, generally uniform in composition, which is loaded directly into the cargo spaces of a ship without any intermediate form of containment.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>7 Bulk carrier bulkhead and double bottom strength standards means "Standards for the evaluation of scantlings of the transverse watertight vertically corrugated bulkhead between the two foremost cargo holds and for the evaluation of allowable hold loading of the foremost cargo hold" adopted by resolution 4 of the Conference of Contracting Governments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 on 27 November 1997, as may be amended by the Organization, provided that such amendments are adopted, brought into force and take effect in accordance with the provisions of article VIII of the present Convention concerning the amendment procedures applicable to the Annex other than chapter I.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>8 Bulk carriers constructed means bulk carriers the keels of which are laid or which are at a similar stage of construction.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>9 A similar stage of construction means the stage at which:</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.1 construction identifiable with a specific ship begins; and</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>.2 assembly of that ship has commenced comprising at least 50 tonnes or one per cent of the estimated mass of all structural material, whichever is less.</H6>
