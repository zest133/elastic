<H3 class=regulation align=center>Special requirements concerning passenger ship stability</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>1 A passenger ship intended to carry 400 or more persons shall have watertight subdivision abaft the collision bulkhead so that s<SUB>i</SUB> = 1 for the three loading conditions on which is based the calculation of the subdivision index and for a damage involving all the compartments within 0.08L measured from the forward perpendicular.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>2 A passenger ship intended to carry 36 or more persons is to be capable of withstanding damage along the side shell to an extent specified in paragraph 3. Compliance with this regulation is to be achieved by demonstrating that s<SUB>i</SUB>, as defined in regulation 7-2, is not less than 0.9 for the three loading conditions on which is based the calculation of the subdivision index.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=justify>3 The damage extent to be assumed when demonstrating compliance with paragraph 2, is to be dependent on both N as defined in regulation 6, and Ls as defined in regulation 2, such that:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 the vertical extent of damage is to extend from the shipâ€™s moulded baseline to a position up to 12.5 m above the position of the deepest subdivision draught as defined in regulation 2, unless a lesser vertical extent of damage were to give a lower value of s<SUB>i</SUB>, in which case this reduced extent is to be used;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 where 400 or more persons are to be carried, a damage length of 0.03Ls but not less than 3 m is to be assumed at any position along the side shell, in conjunction with a penetration inboard of 0.1B but not less than 0.75 m measured inboard from the ship side, at right angle to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision draught;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 where less than 400 persons are carried, damage length is to be assumed at any position along the shell side between transverse watertight bulkheads provided that the distance between two adjacent transverse watertight bulkheads is not less than the assumed damage length. If the distance between adjacent transverse watertight bulkheads is less than the assumed damage length, only one of these bulkheads shall be considered effective for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with paragraph 2;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 where 36 persons are carried, a damage length of 0.015Ls but not less than 3 m is to be assumed, in conjunction with a penetration inboard of 0.05B but not less than 0.75 m; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.5 where more than 36, but fewer than 400 persons are carried the values of damage length and penetration inboard, used in the determination of the assumed extent of damage, are to be obtained by linear interpolation between the values of damage length and penetration which apply for ships carrying 36 persons and 400 persons as specified in subparagraphs .4 and .2.</H5></BODY></HTML>
