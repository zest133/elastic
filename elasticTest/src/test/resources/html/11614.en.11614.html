<H4 class=subtitle align=left>THE CONFERENCE,</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>RECOGNIZING that the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS Convention) and the Protocol of 1978 relating to that Convention (SOLAS Protocol) when implemented, can make a significant improvement in the safety of ships and property at sea and the life of persons on board,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>NOTING that the SOLAS Protocol adopted by the Conference cannot enter into force before the SOLAS Convention enters into force,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>DESIRING to bring the SOLAS Convention and the SOLAS Protocol into force as soon as possible,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>RECOMMENDS that all Governments concerned adopt a target date of June 1979 for the entry into force of the SOLAS Convention and endeavour to ensure that the SOLAS Protocol enters into force at the same time or as soon as possible thereafter,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>RECOMMENDS ALSO that those states which contemplate becoming Parties to the SOLAS Convention:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(a) make every effort to deposit their instruments of ratification, approval, acceptance or accession at the earliest possible date, but not later than June 1978;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(b) deposit instruments of ratification, approval or acceptance of, or accession to, the SOLAS Protocol when it is open for signature or as soon as possible thereafter; and when it becomes possible to do so, endeavour to deposit instruments of ratification, approval or acceptance of, or accession to, both the SOLAS Convention and the SOLAS Protocol simultaneously;</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>(c) if they have not deposited such instruments before June 1978, give the Secretary-General of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization by that date an indication of the period within which they expect to be able to do so,</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>RECOMMENDS ALSO that States which gave deposited instruments of ratification of the SOLAS Convention should deposit instruments of ratification of the SOLAS Protocol as soon as possible,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>RECOMMENDS FURTHER that, prior to the entry into force of the SOLAS Protocol, Administrations should ensure that the provisions of that instrument are applied to new tankers by the date fixed in respect of requirements which contain a specific implemented date,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>NOTING that, with regard to existing ships, the SOLAS Protocol prescribes that the requirements should be implemented in relation to the date on which that Protocol enters into force,</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>INVITES all Governments concerned to put theses requirements into effect to the maximum extent, without waiting for the entry onto force of the SOLAS Protocol, by the following dates, or as soon as possible thereafter, namely:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>- Requirements for inert gas systems contained in Regulation 60 of Chapter II-2 of the SOLAS Protocol Existing tankers of 70,000 tons deadweight and above : by June 1981 Existing tankers of 40,000 tons deadweight and above but below 70,000 tons deadweight, and existing crude oil tankers of 20,000 tons and above but below 40,000 tons deadweight fitted with high capacity tank washing machines: by June 1983</H6>
