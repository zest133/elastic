<H3 class=regulation align=center>Ventilation</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The arrangement and positioning of openings in the cargo tank deck from which gas emission can occur shall be such as to minimize the possibility of gas being admitted to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition, or collecting in the vicinity of deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard. In every case the height of the outlet above the deck and the discharge velocity of the gas shall be considered in conjunction with the distance of any outlet from any deckhouse opening or source of ignition.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The arrangement of ventilation inlets and outlets and other deckhouse and superstructure boundary space openings shall be such as to complement the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Regulation. Such vents especially for machinery spaces shall be situated as far aft as practicable. Due consideration in this regard should be given when the ship is equipped to load or discharge at the stern. Sources of ignition such as electrical equipment shall be so arranged as to avoid an explosion hazard.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Cargo pump rooms shall be mechanically ventilated and discharges from the exhaust fans shall be led to a safe place on the open deck. The ventilation of these rooms shall have sufficient capacity to minimize the possibility of accumulation of inflammable vapours. The number of changes of air shall be at least 20 times per hour, based upon the gross volume of the space. The air ducts shall be arranged so that all of the space is effectively ventilated. The ventilation shall be of the suction type.</H4></BODY></HTML>
