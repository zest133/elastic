<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 The extension required in paragraph 3 need not be fitted directly above the bulkhead below, provided that all parts of the extension are not located forward of the forward limit specified in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2. However, in ships constructed before 1 July 1997:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 where a sloping ramp forms part of the extension, the part of the extension, which is more than 2.3m above the bulkhead deck, may extend no more than 1m forward of the forward limits specified in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2;and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 where the existing ramp does not comply with the requirements for acceptance as an extension to the collision bulkhead and the position of the ramp prevents the siting of such extension within the limits specified in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, the extension may be sited within a limited distance aft of the aft limit specified in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2. The limited distance aft should be no more than is necessary to ensure non interference with the ramp. The extension to the collision bulkhead shall open forward and comply with the requirements of paragraph 3 and shall be so arranged as to preclude the possibility of the ramp causing damage to it in the case of damage to, or detachment of, the ramp.</H5>
