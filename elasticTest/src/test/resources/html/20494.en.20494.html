<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 The venting arrangements shall be so designed and operated as to ensure that neither pressure nor vacuum in cargo tanks shall exceed design parameters and be such as to provide for:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 the flow of the small volumes of vapour, air or inert gas mixtures caused by thermal variations in a cargo tank in all cases through pressure/vacuum valves; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 the passage of large volumes of vapour, air or inert gas mixtures during cargo loading and ballasting, or during discharging.</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 a secondary means of allowing full flow relief of vapour, air or inert gas mixtures to prevent over-pressure or under-pressure in the event of failure of the arrangements in 1.2.2. Alternatively, pressure sensors may be fitted in each tank protected by the arrangement required in 1.2.2, with a monitoring system in the ship's cargo control room or the position from which cargo operations are normally carried out. Such monitoring equipment shall also provide an alarm facility which is activated by detection of over-pressure or under-pressure conditions within a tank.</H6>
