<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Flue gas isolating valves shall be fitted in the inert gas supply mains between the boiler uptakes and the flue gas scrubber. These valves shall be provided with indicators to show whether they are open or shut, and precautions shall be taken to maintain them gastight and keep the seatings clear of soot. Arrangements shall be made to ensure that boiler soot blowers cannot be operated when the corresponding flue gas valve is open.</H4>
