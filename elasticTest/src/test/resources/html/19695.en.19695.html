<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" class=regulation>Bilge pumping arrangements</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(Paragraphs 1.6 and 2.9 of this regulation apply to ships constructed on or after 1 February 1992)</H4>
<H4 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" class=subtitle>1 Passenger ships and cargo ships</H4>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.1 An efficient bilge pumping system shall be provided, capable of pumping from and draining any watertight compartment other than a space permanently appropriated for the carriage of fresh water, waterballast, oil fuel or liquid cargo and for which other efficient means of pumping are provided, under all practical conditions. Efficient means shall be provided for draining water from insulated holds.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.2 Sanitary, ballast and general service pumps may be accepted as independent power bilge pumps if fitted with the necessary connections to the bilge pumping system.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.3 All bilge pipes used in or under coal bunkers or fuel storage tanks or in boiler or machinery spaces, including spaces in which oil-settling tanks or oil fuel pumping units are situated, shall be of steel or other suitable material.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.4 The arrangement of the bilge and ballast pumping system shall be such as to prevent the possibility of water passing from the sea and from water ballast spaces into the cargo and machinery spaces, or from one compartment to another. Provision shall be made to prevent any deep tank having bilge and ballast connections being inadvertently flooded from the sea when containing cargo, or being discharged through a bilge pipe when containing water ballast.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.5 All distribution boxes and manually operated valves in connection with the bilge pumping arrangements shall be in positions which are accessible under ordinary circumstances.</H5>
<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>1.6 Provisions shall be made for the drainage of enclosed cargo spaces situated on the bulkhead deck of a passenger ship and on the freeboard deck of a cargo ship, provided that the Administration may permit the means of drainage to be dispensed with in any particular compartment of any ship or class of ship if it is satisfied that by reason of size or internal subdivision of those spaces the safety of the ship is not thereby impaired.</H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>1.6.1 Where the freeboard to the bulkhead deck or the freeboard deck, respectively, is such that the deck edge is immersed when the ship heels more than 5Â°, the drainage shall be by means of a sufficient number of scuppers of suitable size discharging directly overboard, fitted in accordance with the requirements of regulation 17 in the case of a passenger ship and the requirements for scuppers, inlets and discharges of the International Convention on Load Lines in force in the case of a cargo ship.</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>1.6.2 Where the freeboard is such that the edge of the bulkhead deck or the edge of the freeboard deck, respectively, is immersed when the ship heels 5 degrees or less, the drainage of the enclosed cargo spaces on the bulkhead deck or on the freeboard deck, respectively, shall be led to a suitable space, or spaces, of adequate capacity, having a high water level alarm and provided with suitable arrangements for discharge overboard. In addition it shall be ensured that:</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.1 the number, size and disposition of the scuppers are such as to prevent unreasonable accumulation of free water;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.2 the pumping arrangements required by this regulation for passenger ships or cargo ships, as applicable, take account of the requirements for any fixed pressure water-spraying fire-extinguishing system;</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.3 water contaminated with petrol or other dangerous substances is not drained to machinery spaces or other spaces where sources of ignition may be present; and</H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.4 where the enclosed cargo space is protected by a carbon dioxide fire-extinguishing system the deck scuppers are fitted with means to prevent the escape of the smothering gas.</H6></BODY></HTML>
