<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Ventilation</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 Cargo pump rooms shall be mechanically ventilated and discharges from the exhaust fans shall be led to a safe place on the open deck. The ventilation of these rooms shall have sufficient capacity to minimize the possibility of accumulation of flammable vapours. The number of change of air shall be at least 20 per hour, based upon the gross volume of the space. The air ducts shall be arranged so that all of the space is effectively ventilated. The ventilation shall be of the suction type using fans of the non-sparking type.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 The arrangement of ventilation inlets and outlets and other deckhouse and superstructure boundary space openings shall be such as to complement the provisions of paragraph 1. Such vents, especially for machinery spaces, shall be situated as far aft as practicable. Due consideration in this regard should be given when the ship is equipped to load or discharge at the stern. Sources of ignition such as electrical equipment shall be so arranged as to avoid an explosion hazard.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.3 In combination carriers all cargo spaces and any enclosed spaces adjacent to cargo spaces shall be capable of being mechanically ventilated. The mechanical ventilation system capable of monitoring flammable vapours shall be provided in cargo pump rooms and pipe ducts and cofferdams referred to in regulation 56.4 adjacent to slop tanks. Suitable arrangements shall be made to facilitate measurement of flammable vapours in all other spaces within the cargo area. Such measurements shall be made possible from open deck or easily accessible positions.</H5>
