<H3 class=regulation align=center>Exemptions from Regulations 3 and 4</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The Contracting Governments consider it highly desirable not to deviate from the application of Regulations 3 and 4 of this Chapter; nevertheless the Administration may grant to individual passenger or cargo ships exemptions of a partial and/or conditional nature, or complete exemption from the requirements of regulation 3 or regulation 4 of this Chapter.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The exemptions permitted under paragraph (a) of this Regulation shall be granted only to a ship engaged on a voyage where the maximum distance of the ship from the shore, the length of the voyage, the absence of general navigational hazards, and other conditions affecting safety are such as to render the full application of regulation 3 or regulation 4 of this Chapter unreasonable or unnecessary. When deciding whether or not to grant exemptions to individual ships, Administrations shall have regard to the effect that exemptions may have upon the general efficiency of the distress service for the safety of all ships. Administrations should bear in mind the desirability of requiring ships which are exempted from the requirement of regulation 3 of this Chapter to be fitted with a radiotelephone station which complies with the provisions of regulations 15 and 16 of this Chapter as a condition of exemption.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Each Administration shall submit to the Organization as soon as possible after the first of January in each year a report showing all exemptions granted under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Regulation during the previous calendar year and giving the reasons for granting such exemptions.</H4>
