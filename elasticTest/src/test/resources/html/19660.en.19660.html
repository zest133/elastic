<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Assumed extent of damage shall be as follows:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 longitudinal extent : 3.0m plus 3 per cent of the length of the ship, or 11.0m whichever is the less. Where the required factor of subdivision is .33 or less the assumed longitudinal extent of damage shall be increased as necessary so as to include any two consecutive main transverse watertight bulkheads;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 transverse extent (measured inboard from the ship's side, at right angles to the centre line at the level of the deepest subdivision load line): a distance of one-fifth of the breadth of the ship, as defined in Reg. 2; and</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 vertical extent: from the base line upwards without limit;</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 if any damage of lesser extent than that indicated in paragraphs 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 would result in a more severe condition regarding heel or loss of metacentric height, such damage shall be assumed in the calculations.</H5>
