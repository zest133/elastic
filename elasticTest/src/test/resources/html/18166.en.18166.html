<H3 class=regulation align=center>Control and compliance measures </H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Control of ships in port </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.1 For the purpose of this chapter, every ship to which this chapter applies is subject to control when in a port of another Contracting Government by officers duly authorised by that Government, who may be the same as those carrying out the functions of regulation I/19. Such control shall be limited to verifying that there is onboard a valid International Ship Security Certificate or a valid Interim International Ships Security Certificate issued under the provisions of part A of the ISPS Code (Certificate), which if valid shall be accepted, unless there are clear grounds for believing that the ship is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or part A of the ISPS Code. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.2 When there are such clear grounds, or where no valid Certificate is produced when required, the officers duly authorized by the Contracting Government shall impose any one or more control measures in relation to that ship as provided in paragraph 1.3. Any such measures imposed must be proportionate, taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>1.3 Such control measures are as follows: inspection of the ship, delaying the ship, detention of the ship, restriction of operations including movement within the port, or expulsion of the ship from port. Such control measures may additionally or alternatively include other lesser administrative or corrective measures. </H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Ships intending to enter a port of another Contracting Government </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 For the purpose of this chapter, a Contracting Government may require that ships intending to enter its ports provide the following information to officers duly authorized by that Government to ensure compliance with this chapter prior to entry into port with the aim of avoiding the need to impose control measures or steps: <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=34745&amp;localekey=en"><IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">&nbsp;MSC/Circ.1130</A></H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 that the ship possesses a valid Certificate and the name of its issuing authority; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 the security level at which the ship is currently operating; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 the security level at which the ship operated in any previous port where it has conducted a ship/port interface within the timeframe specified in paragraph 2.3; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 any special or additional security measures that were taken by the ship in any previous port where it has conducted a ship/port interface within the timeframe specified in paragraph 2.3; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.5 that the appropriate ship security procedures were maintained during any ship to ship activity within the timeframe specified in paragraph 2.3; or </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.6 other practical security related information (but not details of the ship security plan), taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>If requested by the Contracting Government, the ship or the Company shall provide confirmation, acceptable to that Contracting Government, of the information required above. </H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 Every ship to which this chapter applies intending to enter the port of another Contracting Government shall provide the information described in paragraph 2.1 on the request of the officers duly authorized by that Government. The master may decline to provide such information on the understanding that failure to do so may result in denial of entry into port. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3 The ship shall keep records of the information referred to in paragraph 2.1 for the last 10 calls at port facilities. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.4 If, after receipt of the information described in paragraph 2.1, officers duly authorised by the Contracting Government of the port in which the ship intends to enter have clear grounds for believing that the ship is in non-compliance with the requirements of this chapter or part A of the ISPS Code, such officers shall attempt to establish communication with and between the ship and the Administration in order to rectify the non-compliance. If such communication does not result in rectification, or if such officers have clear grounds otherwise for believing that the ship is in non-compliance with the requirements of this chapter or part A of the ISPS Code, such officers may take steps in relation to that ship as provided in paragraph 2.5. Any such steps taken must be proportionate, taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.5 Such steps are as follows: </H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 a requirement for the rectification of the non-compliance; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 a requirement that the ship proceed to a location specified in the territorial sea or internal waters of that Contracting Government; </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 inspection of the ship, if the ship is in the territorial sea of the Contracting Government the port of which the ship intends to enter; or </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4 denial of entry into port. </H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>Prior to initiating any such steps, the ship shall be informed by the Contracting Government of its intentions. Upon this information the master may withdraw the intention to enter that port. In such cases, this regulation shall not apply. </H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Additional provisions </H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.1 In the event: </H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 of the imposition of a control measure, other than a lesser administrative or corrective measure, referred to in paragraph 1.3; or </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 any of the steps referred to in paragraph 2.5 are taken, </H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>an officer duly authorized by the Contracting Government shall forthwith inform in writing the Administration specifying which control measures have been imposed or steps taken and the reasons thereof. The Contracting Government imposing the control measures or steps shall also notify the recognized security organization, which issued the Certificate relating to the ship concerned and the Organization when any such control measures have been imposed or steps taken. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.2 When entry into port is denied or the ship is expelled from port, the authorities of the port State should communicate the appropriate facts to the authorities of the State of the next appropriate ports of call, when known, and any other appropriate coastal States, taking into account guidelines to be developed by the Organization. Confidentiality and security of such notification shall be ensured. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.3 Denial of entry into port, pursuant to paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5, or expulsion from port, pursuant to paragraphs 1.1 to 1.3, shall only be imposed where the officers duly authorized by the Contracting Government have clear grounds to believe that the ship poses an immediate threat to the security or safety of persons, or of ships or other property and there are no other appropriate means for removing that threat. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.4 The control measures referred to in paragraph 1.3 and the steps referred to in paragraph 2.5 shall only be imposed, pursuant to this regulation, until the non-compliance giving rise to the control measures or steps has been corrected to the satisfaction of the Contracting Government, taking into account actions proposed by the ship or the Administration, if any. </H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>3.5 When Contracting Governments exercise control under paragraph 1 or take steps under paragraph 2: </H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 all possible efforts shall be made to avoid a ship being unduly detained or delayed. If a ship is thereby unduly detained, or delayed, it shall be entitled to compensation for any loss or damage suffered; and </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 necessary access to the ship shall not be prevented for emergency or humanitarian reasons and for security purposes. </H6></BODY></HTML>
