<H3 class=regulation align=center>Inflatable liferafts</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Inflatable liferafts shall comply with the requirements of regulation 38 and, in addition, shall comply with the requirements of this regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Construction of inflatable liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.1 The main buoyancy chamber shall be divided into not less than two separate compartments, each inflated through a non-return inflation valve on each compartment. The buoyancy chambers shall be so arranged that, in the event of any one of the compartments being damaged or failing to inflate, the intact compartments shall be able to support, with positive freeboard over the liferaft's entire periphery, the number of persons which the liferaft is permitted to accommodate, each having a mass of 75 kg and seated in their normal positions.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.2 The floor of the liferaft shall be waterproof and shall be capable of being sufficiently insulated against cold either:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 by means of one or more compartments that the occupants can inflate, or which inflate automatically and can be deflated and reinflated by the occupants; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 by other equally efficient means not dependent on inflation.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.3 The liferaft shall be inflated with a non-toxic gas. Inflation shall be completed within a period of 1 min at an ambient temperature of between 18°C and 20°C and within a period of 3 min at an ambient temperature of -30°C. After inflation the liferaft shall maintain its form when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>2.4 Each inflatable compartment shall be capable of withstanding a pressure equal to at least 3 times the working pressure and shall be prevented from reaching a pressure exceeding twice the working pressure either by means of relief valves or by a limited gas supply. Means shall be provided for fitting the topping-up pump or bellows required by paragraph 10.1.2 so that the working pressure can be maintained.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 Carrying capacity of inflatable liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>The number of persons which a liferaft shall be permitted to accommodate shall be equal to the lesser of:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 the greatest whole number obtained by dividing by 0.096 the volume, measured in cubic metres of the main buoyancy tubes (which for this purpose shall include neither the arches nor the thwarts if fitted) when inflated; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 the greatest whole number obtained by dividing by 0.372 the inner horizontal cross-sectional area of the liferaft measured in square metres (which for this purpose may include the thwart or thwarts, if fitted) measured to the innermost edge of the buoyancy tubes; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 the number of persons having an average mass of 75 kg , all wearing lifejackets, that can be seated with sufficient comfort and headroom without interfering with the operation of any of the liferaft's equipment.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Access into inflatable liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 At least one entrance shall be fitted with a semi-rigid boarding ramp to enable persons to board the liferaft from the sea so arranged as to prevent significant deflation of the liferaft if the ramp is damaged. In the case of a davit-launched liferaft having more than one entrance, the boarding ramp shall be fitted at the entrance opposite the bowsing lines and embarkation facilities.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 Entrances not provided with a boarding ramp shall have a boarding ladder, the lowest step of which shall be situated not less than 0.4 m below the liferaft's light waterline.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.3 There shall be means inside the liferaft to assist persons to pull themselves into the liferaft from the ladder.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 Stability of inflatable liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.1 Every inflatable liferaft shall be so constructed that, when fully inflated and floating with the canopy uppermost, it is stable in a seaway.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.2 The stability of the liferaft when in the inverted position shall be such that it can be righted in a seaway and in calm water by one person.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.3 The stability of the liferaft when loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment shall be such that it can be towed at speeds of up to 3 knots in calm water.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Inflatable liferaft fittings</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.1 The breaking strength of the painter system including its means of attachment to the liferaft, except the weak link required by regulation 38.6, shall be not less than 10.0 kN for a liferaft permitted to accommodate nine persons or more, and not less than 7.5 kN for any other liferaft. The liferaft shall be capable of being inflated by one person.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.2 A manually controlled lamp visible on a dark night with a clear atmosphere at a distance of at least 2 miles for a period of not less than 12 h shall be fitted to the top of the liferaft canopy. If the light is a flashing light it shall flash at a rate of not less than 50 flashes per minute for the first 2 h of operation of the 12 h operating period. The lamp shall be powered by a sea-activated cell or a dry chemical cell and shall light automatically when the liferaft inflates. The cell shall be of a type that does not deteriorate due to damp or humidity in the stowed liferaft.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.3 A manually controlled lamp shall be fitted inside the liferaft capable of continuous operation for a period of at least 12 h. It shall light automatically when the liferaft inflates and be of sufficient intensity to enable reading of survival and equipment instructions.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>7 Containers for inflatable liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7.1 The liferaft shall be packed in a container that is:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 so constructed as to withstand hard wear under conditions encountered at sea;</H6>

<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.3 as far as practicable watertight, except for drain holes in the container bottom.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7.2 The liferaft shall be packed in its container in such a way as to ensure, as far as possible, that the waterborne liferaft inflates in an upright position on breaking free from its container.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>7.3 The container shall be marked with:</H5>

<H4 class=subtitle align=left>9 Davit-launched inflatable liferafts</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>9.1 In addition to complying with the above requirements, a liferaft for use with an approved launching appliance shall, when suspended from its lifting hook or bridle, withstand a load of:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 4 times the mass of its full complement of persons and equipment, at an ambient temperature and a stabilized liferaft temperature of 20 ±3°C with all relief valves inoperative; and</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 1.1 times the mass of its full complement of persons and equipment at an ambient temperature and a stabilized liferaft temperature of -30°C with all relief valves operative.</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>9.2 Rigid containers for liferafts to be launched by a launching appliance shall be so secured that the container or parts of it are prevented from falling into the sea during and after inflation and launching of the contained liferaft.</H5>
