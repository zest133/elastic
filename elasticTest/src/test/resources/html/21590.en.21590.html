<H5 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body1>7.4 Ventilation systems for passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers </H5>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>7.4.1 The ventilation system of a passenger ship carrying more than 36 passengers shall be in compliance with the following additional requirements. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>7.4.2 In general, the ventilation fans shall be so disposed that the ducts reaching the various spaces remain within the main vertical zone. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>7.4.3 Where ventilation systems penetrate decks, precautions shall be taken, in addition to those relating to the fire integrity of the deck required by paragraphs 3.1 and 4.1.1.5, to reduce the likelihood of smoke and hot gases passing from one 'tween-deck space to another through the system. In addition to insulation requirements contained in paragraph 7.4, vertical ducts shall, if necessary, be insulated as required by the appropriate tables 9.1 and 9.2. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>7.4.4 Except in cargo spaces, ventilation ducts shall be constructed of the following materials: </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.1 ducts not less than 0.075 m² in free cross-sectional area and all vertical ducts serving more than a single 'tween-deck space shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material; </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.2 ducts less than 0.075 m² in free cross-sectional area other than the vertical ducts referred to in paragraph 7.4.4.1, shall be constructed of <U>steel or equivalent</U> materials. Where such ducts penetrate "A" or "B" class division due regard shall be given to ensuring the fire integrity of the division; and </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body3>.3 short length of duct, not in general exceeding 0.02m² in free cross-sectional area nor 2 m in length, need not be <U>steel or equivalent</U> provided that all of the following conditions are met: </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4>.3.1 <U>subject to paragraph 7.4.4.3.2</U> the duct is constructed of <U>any</U> material which has low flame spread characteristics; </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body4><U>.3.2 on ships constructed on or after 1 July 2010, the ducts shall be made of heat resisting non-combustible material, which may be faced internally and externally with membranes having low flame-spread characteristics and, in each case, a calorific value* not exceeding 45 MJ/m2 of their surface area for the thickness used;</U>&nbsp; (<IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px solid" alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content"> Added by <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=49218&amp;localekey=en">Res.MSC.269(85)</A>) </H6>

<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>7.4.5 Stairway enclosures shall be ventilated and served by an independent fan and duct system which shall not serve any other spaces in the ventilation systems. </H6>
<H6 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" class=body2>7.4.6 Exhaust ducts shall be provided with hatches for inspection and cleaning. The hatches shall be located near the fire dampers. </H6></BODY></HTML>
