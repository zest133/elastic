<H2 class=part align=center>Part D - FIRE SAFETY MEASURES FOR TANKERS</H2>
<H2 class=part align=center>(The requirements of this Part are additional to those of Part C except for Regulations 53 and 54 which do not apply to tankers and except as provided otherwise in Regulations 57 and 58)</H2>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Regulation 55</H3>
<H3 class=regulation align=center>Application</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>1 Unless expressly provided otherwise, this Part shall apply to tankers carrying crude oil and petroleum products having a flashpoint not exceeding 60 degrees C (closed cup test), as determined by an approved flashpoint apparatus, and a Reid vapour pressure which is below atmospheric pressure and other liquid products having a similar fire hazard.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2 Where liquid cargoes other than those referred to in paragraph 1 or liquefied gases which introduce additional fire hazards are intended to be carried, additional safety measures shall be required to the satisfaction of the Administration, having due regard to the provisions of the Bulk Chemical Code and the Gas Carrier Code.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>3 This paragraph applies to all ships which are combination carriers. Such ships shall not carry solid cargoes unless all cargo tanks are empty of oil and gas freed or unless the arrangements provided in each case are to the satisfaction of the Administration and in accordance with the relevant operational requirements contained in the Guidelines for Inert Gas Systems*.</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Reference is made to Revised Guidelines for Inert Gas Systems, adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee at its forty-eighth session in June 1983 <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12478&amp;localekey=en">(MSC/Circ. 353).</A></H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>4 Tankers carrying petroleum products having a flashpoint exceeding 60 degrees C (closed cup test) as determined by an approved flashpoint apparatus shall comply with the provisions of Part C, except that in lieu of the fixed fire-extinguishing system required in Reg. 53 they shall be fitted with a fixed deck foam system which shall comply with the provisions of Reg. 61.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>5 The requirements for inert gas systems of regulation 60 need not be applied to:</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.1 chemical tankers constructed before, on or after 1 July 1986 when carrying cargoes described in paragraph 1, provided that they comply with the requirements for inert gas systems on chemical tankers developed by the Organization *; or</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Reference is made to Regulation for Inert Gas Systems on Chemical Tankers adopted by the Organization by Resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=7123&amp;localekey=en">A.567(14).</A></H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.2 chemical tankers constructed before 1 July 1986, when carrying crude oil or petroleum products, provided that they comply with the requirements for inert gas systems on chemical tankers carrying petroleum products developed by the Organization **; or</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>** Reference is made to Interim Regulation for Inert Gas Systems on Chemical Tankers Carrying Petroleum Products, adopted by the Organization by resolution A.473(XII).</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.3 gas carriers constructed before, on or after 1 July 1986, when carrying cargoes described in paragraph 1, provided that they are fitted with cargo tank inerting arrangements equivalent to those specified in subparagraph 5.1 or 5.2; or</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>.4 chemical tankers and gas carriers when carrying flammable cargoes other than crude oil or petroleum products such as cargoes listed in chapters VI and VII of the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk or chapters 17 or 18 of the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk:</H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4.1 if constructed before 1 July 1986; or</H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.4.2 if constructed on or after 1 July 1986, provided that the capacity of tanks used for their carriage does not exceed 3,000m³and the individual nozzle capacities of tank washing machines do not exceed 17.5 m³/h and the total combined throughput from the number of machines in use in a cargo tank at any one time does not exceed 110 m³/h.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>6 Chemical tankers and gas carriers shall comply with the requirements of this Part, except where alternative and supplementary arrangements are provided to the satisfaction of the Administration, having due regard to the provisions of the International Bulk Chemical Code, the Bulk Chemical Code, the International Gas Carrier Code and the Gas Carrier Code, as appropriate.</H4></BODY></HTML>
