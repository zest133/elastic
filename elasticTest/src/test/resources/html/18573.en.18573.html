<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.1 Installation </H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>A fixed fire detection and fire alarm system shall be installed in: </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.1 periodically unattended machinery spaces; and </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>.2 machinery spaces where: </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.1 the installation of automatic and remote control systems and equipment has been approved in lieu of continuous manning of the space; and </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2.2 the main propulsion and associated machinery including sources of main source of electrical power are provided with various degrees of automatic or remote control and are under continuous manned supervision from a control room. </H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>4.2 Design&nbsp; <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=233&amp;localekey=en"></A></H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>The fixed fire detection and fire alarm system required in paragraph 4.1.1 shall be so designed and the detectors so positioned as to detect rapidly the onset of fire in any part of those spaces and under any normal conditions of operation of the machinery and variations of ventilation as required by the possible range of ambient temperatures. Except in spaces of restricted height and where their use is specially appropriate, detection systems using only thermal detectors shall not be permitted. The detection system shall initiate audible and visual alarms distinct in both respects from the alarms of any other system not indicating fire, in sufficient places to ensure that the alarms are heard and observed on the navigating bridge and by a responsible engineer officer. When the navigating bridge is unmanned the alarm shall sound in a place where a responsible member of the crew is on duty. </H6></BODY></HTML>
