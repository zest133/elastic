<H3 class=regulation align=center>Construction and Initial Testing of Watertight Bulkheads, etc.</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Each watertight subdivision bulkhead, whether transverse or longitudinal, shall be constructed in such a manner that it shall be capable of supporting, with a proper margin of resistance, the pressure due to the maximum head of water which it might have to sustain in the event of damage to the ship but at least the pressure due to a head of water up to the margin line. The construction of these bulkheads shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b)</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Steps and recesses in bulkheads shall be watertight and as strong as the bulkhead at the place where each occurs.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(ii) Where frames or beams pass through a watertight deck or bulkhead, such deck or bulkhead shall be made structurally watertight without the use of wood or cement.</H5>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) Testing main compartments by filling them with water is not compulsory. When testing by filling with water is not carried out, a hose test is compulsory; this test shall be carried out in the most advanced stage of the fitting out of the ship. In any case, a thorough inspection of the watertight bulkheads shall be carried out.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The forepeak, double bottoms (including duct keels) and inner skins shall be tested with water to a head corresponding to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this Regulation.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) Tanks which are intended to hold liquids, and which form part of the subdivision of the ship, shall be tested for tightness with water to a head up to the deepest subdivision load line or to a head corresponding to two-thirds of the depth from the top of keel to the margin line in way of the tanks, whichever is the greater; provided that in no case shall the test head be less than 0.92 metres (3 feet) above the top of the tank.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) The tests referred to in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this Regulation are for the purpose of ensuring that the subdivision structural arrangements are watertight and are not to be regarded as a test of the fitness of any compartment for the storage of oil fuel or for other special purposes for which a test of a superior character may be required depending on the height to which the liquid has access in the tank or its connections.</H4></BODY></HTML>
