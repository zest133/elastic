<H5 class=body1 align=justify>5.2 Restriction on boundary openings </H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>5.2.1 Except as permitted in paragraph 5.2.2, access doors, air inlets and openings to accommodation spaces, service spaces, control stations and machinery spaces shall not face the cargo area. They shall be located on the transverse bulkhead not facing the cargo area or on the outboard side of the superstructure or deckhouse at a distance of at least 4% of the length of the ship but not less than 3 m from the end of the superstructure or deckhouse facing the cargo area. This distance need not exceed 5 m. <IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">&nbsp;<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=224&amp;localekey=en">IACS UI SC 120</A></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>5.2.2 The Administration may permit access doors in boundary bulkheads facing the cargo area or within the 5 m limits specified in paragraph 5.2.1, to main cargo control stations and to such service spaces used as provision rooms, store-rooms and lockers, provided they do not give access directly or indirectly to any other space containing or providing for accommodation, control stations or service spaces such as galleys, pantries or workshops, or similar spaces containing sources of vapour ignition. The boundary of such a space shall be insulated to "A-60" class standard, with the exception of the boundary facing the cargo area. Bolted plates for the removal of machinery may be fitted within the limits specified in paragraph 5.2.1. Wheelhouse doors and windows may be located within the limits specified in paragraph 5.2.1 so long as they are designed to ensure that the wheelhouse can be made rapidly and efficiently gas and vapour tight. <IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">&nbsp;<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=224&amp;localekey=en">IACS UI SC 120</A>, <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=159&amp;localekey=en">SC55</A></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>5.2.3 Windows and sidescuttles facing the cargo area and on the sides of the superstructures and deckhouses within the limits specified in paragraph 5.2.1 shall be of the fixed (non-opening) type. Such windows and sidescuttles, except wheelhouse windows, shall be constructed to "A-60" class standard. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>5.2.4 Where there is permanent access from a pipe tunnel to the main pump-room, a watertight door shall be fitted complying with the requirements of regulation II-1/25-9.2 and, in addition, with the following: </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1 in addition to the bridge operation, the watertight door shall be capable of being manually closed from outside the main pump-room entrance; and </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2 the watertight door shall be kept closed during normal operations of the ship except when access to the pipe tunnel is required. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>5.2.5 Permanent approved gastight lighting enclosures for illuminating cargo pump-rooms may be permitted in bulkheads and decks separating cargo pump-rooms and other spaces provided they are of adequate strength and the integrity and gastightness of the bulkhead or deck is maintained. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>5.2.6 The arrangement of ventilation inlets and outlets and other deckhouse and superstructure boundary space openings shall be such as to complement the provisions of paragraph 5.3 and regulation 11.6. Such vents, especially for machinery spaces, shall be situated as far aft as practicable. Due consideration in this regard shall be given when the ship is equipped to load or discharge at the stern. Sources of ignition such as electrical equipment shall be so arranged as to avoid an explosion hazard. </H6></BODY></HTML>
