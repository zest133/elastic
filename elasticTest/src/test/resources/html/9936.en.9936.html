<H3 class=regulation align=center>Fixed Pressure Water-Spraying Fire-Extinguishing Systems in Machinery Spaces</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) Any required fixed pressure water-spraying fire-extinguishing system in machinery spaces shall be provided with spraying nozzles of an approved type.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The number and arrangement of the nozzles shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration and be such as to ensure an effective average distribution of water of at least 5 litres per square metre (0.1 gallon per square foot) per minute in the spaces to be protected. Where increased application rates are considered necessary, these shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration. Nozzles shall be fitted above bilges, tank tops and other areas over which oil fuel is liable to spread and also above other specific fire hazards in the machinery spaces.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The system may be divided into sections, the distribution valves of which shall be operated from easily accessible positions outside the spaces to be protected and which will not be readily cut off by an outbreak of fire.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) The system shall be kept charged at the necessary pressure and the pump supplying the water for the system shall be put automatically into action by a pressure drop in the system.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) The pump shall be capable of simultaneously supplying at the necessary pressure all sections of the system in any one compartment to be protected. The pump and its controls shall be installed outside the space or spaces to be protected. It shall not be possible for a fire in the space or spaces protected by the water-spraying system to put the system out of action.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) The pump may be driven by independent internal combustion type machinery but if it is dependent upon power being supplied from the emergency generator fitted in compliance with the provisions of Regulation 25 or Regulation 26 as appropriate of Chapter II-1 of the present Convention that generator shall be arranged to start automatically in case of main power failure so that power for the pump required by paragraph (e) of this Regulation is immediately available. When the pump is driven by independent internal combustion type machinery it shall be so situated that a fire in the protected space will not affect the air supply to the machinery.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) Precautions shall be taken to prevent the nozzles from becoming clogged by impurities in the water or corrosion of piping, nozzles, valves and pump.</H4></BODY></HTML>
