<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.1 Fixed fire-extinguishing systems * </H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Guidelines when approving alternative fixed water-based fire-fighting systems for use in special category spaces <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12773&amp;localekey=en">(MSC/ Circ.914). </A></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>6.1.1 Vehicle spaces and ro-ro spaces which are not special category spaces and are capable of being sealed from a location outside of the cargo spaces shall be fitted with a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system which shall comply with the provisions of the Fire Safety Systems Code, except that: </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1 if a carbon dioxide system is fitted, the quantity of gas available shall be at least sufficient to give a minimum volume of free gas equal to 45% of the gross volume of the largest such cargo space which is capable of being sealed, and the arrangements shall be such as to ensure that at least two thirds of the gas required for the relevant space shall be introduced within 10 min;&nbsp; <IMG border=0 alt=Go! src="/images/icon/link.gif?fullpathlink=content">&nbsp;<A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=232&amp;localekey=en">IACS UI SC 128</A></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2 any other fixed inert gas fire-extinguishing system or fixed high expansion foam fire-extinguishing system may be fitted provided the Administration is satisfied that an equivalent protection is achieved; and </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3 as an alternative, a system meeting the requirements of paragraph 6.1.2 may be fitted. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>6.1.2 Ro-ro and vehicle spaces not capable of being sealed and special category spaces shall be fitted with an approved fixed pressure water spraying system* for manual operation which shall protect all parts of any deck and vehicle platform in such spaces. Such water spray systems shall have: </H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Recommendation on fixed fire-extinguishing systems for special cargo spaces as adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=6955&amp;localekey=en">A.123(V). </A></H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1 a pressure gauge on the valve manifold; </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2 clear marking on each manifold valve indicating the spaces served; </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.3 instructions for maintenance and operation located in the valve room; and </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.4 a sufficient number of drainage valves. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>6.1.3 The Administration may permit the use of any other fixed fire-extinguishing system* that has been shown that it is not less effective by a full-scale test in conditions simulating a flowing petrol fire in a vehicle space or a ro-ro space in controlling fires likely to occur in such a space. </H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Guidelines when approving alternative fixed water-based fire-fighting systems for use in special category spaces <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=12773&amp;localekey=en">(MSC/ Circ.914). </A></H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>6.1.4 When fixed pressure water-spraying systems are provided, in view of the serious loss of stability which could arise due to large quantities of water accumulating on the deck or decks during the operation of the fixed pressure water-spraying system; the following arrangements shall be provided: </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1 in passenger ships: </H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify>.1.1 in the spaces above the bulkhead deck, scuppers shall be fitted so as to ensure that such water is rapidly discharged directly overboard; </H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify>.1.2.1 in ro-ro passenger ships discharge valves for scuppers, fitted with positive means of closing operable from a position above the bulkhead deck in accordance with the requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines in force, shall be kept open while the ships are at sea; </H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify>.1.2.2 any operation of valves referred to in paragraph 6.1.4.1.2.1 shall be recorded in the log-book; </H6>
<H6 class=body4 align=justify>.1.3 in the spaces below the bulkhead deck, the Administration may require pumping and drainage facilities to be provided additional to the requirements of regulation II-1/21. In such case, the drainage system shall be sized to remove no less than 125% of the combined capacity of both the water spraying system pumps and the required number of fire hose nozzles. The drainage system valves shall be operable from outside the protected space at a position in the vicinity of the extinguishing system controls. Bilge wells shall be of sufficient holding capacity and shall be arranged at the side shell of the ship at a distance from each other of not more than 40 m in each watertight compartment; </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2 in cargo ships, the drainage and pumping arrangements shall be such as to prevent the build-up of free surfaces. In such case, the drainage system shall be sized to remove no less than 125% of the combined capacity of both the water spraying system pumps and the required number of fire hose nozzles. The drainage system valves shall be operable from outside the protected space at a position in the vicinity of the extinguishing system controls. Bilge wells shall be of sufficient holding capacity and shall be arranged at the side shell of the ship at a distance from each other of not more than 40 m in each watertight compartment. If this is not possible the adverse effect upon stability of the added weight and free surface of water shall be taken into account to the extent deemed necessary by the Administration in its approval of the stability information.* Such information shall be included in the stability information supplied to the master as required by regulation II-1/22. </H6>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* Refer to the Recommendation on fixed fire-extinguishing systems for special cargo spaces as adopted by the Organization by resolution <A href="/contents.aspx?categoryid=6955&amp;localekey=en">A.123(V). </A></H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>6.2 Portable fire extinguishers </H5>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>6.2.1 Portable extinguishers shall be provided at each deck level in each hold or compartment where vehicles are carried, spaced not more than 20 m apart on both sides of the space. At least one portable fire-extinguisher shall be located at each access to such a cargo space. </H6>
<H6 class=body2 align=justify>6.2.2 In addition to the provision of paragraph 6.2.1, the following fire extinguishing appliances shall be provided in vehicle, ro-ro and special category spaces intended for the carriage of motor vehicles with fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion: </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.1 at least three water-fog applicators; and </H6>
<H6 class=body3 align=justify>.2 one portable foam applicator unit complying with the provisions of the Fire Safety Systems Code, provided that at least two such units are available in the ship for use in such ro-ro spaces. </H6></BODY></HTML>
