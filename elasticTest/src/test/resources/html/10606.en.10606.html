<H3 class=regulation align=center>Radiotelegraph Installation for Lifeboats</H3>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(a) The radiotelegraph installation required by regulation 14 of Chapter III shall include a transmitter, a receiver and a source of energy. It shall be so designed that it can be used in an emergency by an unskilled person.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(b) The transmitter shall be capable of transmitting on the radiotelegraph distress frequency using a class of emission assigned by the Radio Regulations for that frequency. The transmitter shall also be capable of transmitting on the frequency, and of using a class of emission, assigned by the Radio Regulations for use by survival craft in the bands between 4,000 kHz and 27,500 kHz.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(c) The transmitter shall, if modulated emission is prescribed by the Radio Regulations, have a depth of modulation of not less than 70 per cent and a note frequency between 450 and 1,350 Hz.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(d) In addition to a key for manual transmissions, the transmitter shall be fitted with an automatic keying device for the transmission of the radiotelegraph alarm and distress signals.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(e) On the radiotelegraph distress frequency the transmitter shall have a minimum normal range (as specified in paragraph (g) of regulation 10 of this Chapter) of 25 miles using the fixed antenna.*</H4>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* In the absence of a measurement of the field strength, it may be assumed that this range will be obtained if the product of the height of the antenna above the water-line and the antenna current (R.M.S. value) is 10 metre-amperes.</H6>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(f) The receiver shall be capable of receiving the radiotelegraph distress frequency and the classes of emission assigned by the Radio Regulations for that frequency.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(g) The source of energy shall consist of an accumulator battery with sufficient capacity to supply the transmitter for four hours continuously under normal working conditions. If the battery is of a type that requires charging, means shall be available for charging it from the ship's power supply. In addition there shall be a means for charging it after the lifeboat has been launched.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(h) When the power for the radiotelegraph installation and the searchlight required by regulation 14 of Chapter III are drawn from the same battery, it shall have sufficient capacity to provide for the additional load of the searchlight.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(i) A fixed-type antenna will be provided together with means for supporting it at the maximum practicable height. In addition an antenna supported by a kite or balloon shall be provided if practicable.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle align=left>(j) At sea a radio officer shall at weekly intervals test the transmitter using a suitable artificial antenna, and shall bring the battery up to full charge if it is of a type which requires charging.</H4></BODY></HTML>
