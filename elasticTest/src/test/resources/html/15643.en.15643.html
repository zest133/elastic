<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">2 Each Contracting Government specially interested in these services whose ships pass through the region of icebergs during the ice season undertakes to contribute to the Government of the United States of America its proportionate share of the costs for the management and operation of the ice patrol service. The contribution to the Government of the United States of America shall be based on the ratio which the average annual gross tonnage of that contributing Government's ships passing through the region of icebergs guarded by the Ice Patrol during the previous three ice seasons bears to the combined average annual gross tonnage of all ships that passed through the region of icebergs guarded by the Ice Patrol during the previous three ice seasons.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">3 All contributions shall be calculated by multiplying the ratio described in paragraph 2 by the average actual annual cost incurred by the Governments of the United States of America and Canada of managing and operating ice patrol services during the previous three years. This ratio shall be computed annually, and shall be expressed in terms of a lump sum per-annual fee.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">4 Each of the contributing Governments has the right to alter or discontinue its contribution, and other interested Governments may undertake to contribute to the expense. The contributing Government which avails itself of this right will continue to be responsible for its current contribution up to 1 September following the date of giving notice of intention to alter or discontinue its contribution. To take advantage of the said right it must give notice to the managing Government at least six months before the said 1 September.</H4>
<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">5 Each contributing Government shall notify the Secretary-General of its undertaking pursuant to paragraph 2, who shall notify all Contracting Governments.</H4>

<H4 class=subtitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">7 The managing government shall publish annual accounts including a statement of costs incurred by the governments providing the services for the past three years and the total gross tonnage using the service for the past three years.
