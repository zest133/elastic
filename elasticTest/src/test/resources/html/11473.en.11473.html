<H4 class=subtitle align=left>2. General Requirements of Nuclear Power Plant</H4>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(a) It should be demonstrated by calculation and experiment that the properties of the plant and the nature of the enclosure provide, the maximum practicable protection against accidents or failures resulting in unreasonable radiation at sea or in port, to the crew, passengers or public, or to the waterways, or food or water resources.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(b) The reactor installation should be designed to prevent an uncontrolled chain reaction under all foreseeable operational and accident conditions including sinking of the ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(c) A nuclear ship equipped with a single-reactor nuclear power plant, the dependability of which has not been Proven, should be Provided with an emergency Propulsion Plant capable of Propelling the ship at a navigable speed. Such emergency propulsion plant should be in a state of readiness whenever the ship is navigating in territorial waters.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(d) The nuclear power plant should be such as to ensure manoeuvrability equivalent to that of a similar conventional ship.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(e) Requirements for standby emergency components for the conventional portions of the nuclear power plant should be in accordance with those for a similar conventional ship. Standby and emergency nuclear components should be considered and developed in relation to the type of nuclear power plant used.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(f) Where standby systems are essential to the safe operation of the reactor installation, they should be so separated from the main systems as to give maximum protection in the event of an accident.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(g) An emergency source of Power should be provided which is capable of furnishing Power to the components necessary for safely shutting down the reactor installation and retaining it in a safe condition.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(h) The reactor compartment should contain no inflammable* materials other than those necessary for use in the reactor installation.</H5>
<H6 class=footnote align=justify>* "Inflammable" has the same meaning as "flammable".</H6>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(i) Reactor materials which are chemically reactive with air or water to a dangerous degree should not be used unless it can be shown that adequate safes guards are incorporated in the particular system.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(j) The machinery and reactor installation should be designed to operate satisfactorily under seagoing conditions having regard to the ship's attitude, accelerations and vibrations.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(k) Reactor cooling systems should provide for the safe removal of decay heat from the reactor and should prevent excessive temperature conditions under all foreseeable operational and accident conditions at angles of heel and list within the stability range. Failure of decay heat removal facilities should not result in the release of hazardous amounts of radioactive or toxic materials from the enclosure of the reactor installation</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(l) Adequate reactor controls, protective devices and instrumentation should be Provided.</H5>
<H5 class=body1 align=justify>(m) Necessary controls and instrumentation should be arranged to permit control of the reactor installation from outside its enclosure.</H5>
