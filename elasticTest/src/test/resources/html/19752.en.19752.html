<H5 class=body1>2.4 Every liferaft on ro-ro passenger ships shall either be automatically self-righting or be a canopied reversible liferaft which is stable in a seaway and is capable of operating safely whichever way up it is floating. Alternatively, the ship shall carry automatically self-righting liferafts or canopied reversible liferafts, in addition to its normal complement of liferafts, of such aggregate capacity as will accommodate at least 50% of the persons not accommodated in lifeboats. This additional liferaft capacity shall be determined on the basic of the difference between the total number of persons on board and the number of persons accommodated in lifeboats. Every such liferaft shall be approved by the Administration having regard to the recommendations adopted by the Organization.*</H5>
